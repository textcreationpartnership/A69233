            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, SIR THOMAS EGERTON KNIGHT, BARON OF Ellesmere, Lord high Chancellor of England, and <hi>one of his Maiesties most honorable priuie Counsell,</hi> I. D. wisheth all grace and prosperitie in this <hi>life, and eternall happinesse in the life to come.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I considered (Right Honorable) the great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issance, and preuailing strength, of these arch-enemies of our saluation, <hi>the world, and worldly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi> manifested in their daily conquests, not onely of those, who voluntarily yeeld at the first onset, and are willingly content to become their vassals and slaues, for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine tenure, and base wages of earthly vanities; but also of such as hauing giuen their names to Christ, by receiuing his sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, professed themselues to be his souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb facs="tcp:10731:3"/> and seruants, and that amongst other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, they would valiantly fight his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, against the world, and worldly lusts: who notwithstanding their oath and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, either yeeld subiection to the world vpon the offer of earthly profits, pleasures, and preferments, or stand in a cold neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, desiring to doe seruice to the world and God too; but without all indifferencie, seeing he hath onely the seruice of their lips, and some outward deuotions, meerely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementall, and ceremoniall; whereas the other master hath the seruice of their hearts, and all their care, labours, and painefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours imploied about him. And when as I saw the glorious trophees of the worlds victories erected, not onely in euery corner of the common-wealth, but euen in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and church of God, to his great disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the disgrace of his true religion; I thought I could not spend my strength in a better quarrell, then in opposing against this enemie of our saluation; to the end, that I might abate his preuailing forces, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the very sinewes of his strength, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee most glorieth and triumpheth; by
<pb facs="tcp:10731:3"/> shewing that the wages of iniquitie whereby he inticeth men to leaue Gods standard, and to fight vnder his colours, is but base and counterfeite coine, being examined by the touchstone of Gods truth, and therefore not to be receiued of a Christian for good pay; much lesse to be preferred before that crowne of victorie, euerlasting glorie, and those all-sufficient treasures of our heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kingdome, which God promiseth to all those who fight his battailes, and valiantly ouercome. Neither did I thinke that I could more profitably spend my studies in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argument, especiallie in these times, wherein the loue of the world so greatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth, that with <hi>Demas</hi> men daily fall from the profession of Gods truth, and imbrace the world, hauing onely so much loue of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as the loue of the world worketh in them; and either not seruing God at all, or only that they may serue their owne turnes, in worldly and carnall respects. For if by plaine testimonies of holy Scriptures, and by effectuall reasons (as it were a proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sent from the great king of heauen and earth) I could crie downe the high rates and
<pb facs="tcp:10731:4"/> prices of these base and copper coynes, and bring them to their owne value; by shewing that there is no excellencie &amp; true worth in them, but onely as they serue for the present necessitie of our earthly state, and to furnish vs in our trauaile towards our heauenly countrie; then would there many and great benefits bee hereby deriued vnto vs. For if we could contemne the world and worldly vanities, as things of small worth, then would they not be as heauie clogs to hinder vs from running the Christian race, and from ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in our meditations into Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to take possession for the present of our heauenly inheritance with our mindes and thoughts, till our soules and bodies doe come thither: then would we not suffer them to take vp all our cogitations, care, studie, and labour, about the getting or preseruing them, so as wee haue little or no time left to performe seruice vnto God; or if at all wee doe it, yet with much distraction and pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation: then would the tentations of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell haue no power to draw vs into sinne, wanting this wages of iniquitie, and these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring baites, wherewith hee inticeth vs to
<pb facs="tcp:10731:4"/> come into his nets of perdition: for who would serue satan for nought, or for such things as he contemneth, or but lightly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lueth, leauing the seruice of his Creator and Redeemer, and thereby hazarding the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall losse of those heauenly excellencies which he hath promised vnto his seruants in the life to come? Then should wee haue a true golden age, free from all oppression, bribing, extortion, fraude, wrongs, dissensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, treasons, rebellions, and innumerable other outrages, which are caused and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned through the immoderate loue of these earthly things; and perfect loue and charitie being entertained amongst men, they would striue who should exceed other in al good and Christian duties, louing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and goodnes for their owne sakes: then would not those who abound with these worldly things be euer the prouder, or with scornefull insolence ouerlooke their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; for who is proud of that which hee contemneth? Neither would those that want them be much troubled, hauing for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Gods better gifts, euen his sanctifying and sauing graces, and for the time to come
<pb facs="tcp:10731:5"/> farre more excellent hopes, life eternall, and the vnspeakeable ioies of Gods glorious kingdome. For who bewaileth the want, or lamenteth the losse of those things which he lightly esteemeth, especially hauing both in possession and hope, such things as are of farre greater worth and excellencie? Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if wee were perswaded to contemne the world and worldly vanities, and highly to esteeme of the ioyes of Heauen, then would we not feare the approach of death, but bid it welcome with a cheerefull countenance? seeing it taketh vs from the things which we doe not much regard, and entreth vs into the possession and fruition of our better hopes; euen a kingdome matchles, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie endlesse. Whereas contrariwise, when these worldly things bee ouerualued, and too much loued and desired, they wholly take vp mens meditations, and disable them for Gods seruice, they lay them open to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans tentations, and make them readie to perpetrate and commit any wickednesse, which may further them to the obtaining of the things which they affect; neither is there any stop in the way to hinder their headlong
<pb facs="tcp:10731:5"/> course in sin, vnlesse it be when their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desires do crosse one another: they puffe men vp with pride when they inioy them, and consume them with griefe and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent when they want them: and to conclude, they make death most terrible, because it plucketh thē violently from these delights, vnto which their hearts are fast glued, and forceth them to leaue the things which they dearely loue, hauing no assurance or hope of a better life. For the auoiding of all which euils, and for the furthering and aduancing of the former benefits, I haue laboured in this argument, euen aboue my strength, God shewing his power in my weakenes, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing my desire to supplie that which was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in my health. Of which my labours I haue chosen your Lordship for patron, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to shew my loue and dutie vnto you, from whom I haue had, both al the meanes of my maintenance which I enioy, wherewith I haue been enabled to labour; and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to exercise that poore talent which I haue receiued from my great Lord and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: and partly because I thought, I could not dedicate vnto you a booke of a fitter ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<pb facs="tcp:10731:6"/> wherein your selfe may at your best leasure meditate; seeing on the one side the greatnes of your place, and height of your honors and preferments may (without your greater vigilance and circumspection) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline your affections too much to the loue of these earthly things, and on the other side your age (vnto which God adde many yeares for his owne glorie, the Churches good, and your owne euerlasting comfort) is not likely in course of nature to allow vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you any long possession of these mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentanie things. In regard of both which, your Honour cannot bee too well armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the immoderate loue of these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanities, nor haue your heart too much inflamed with that diuine loue of Heauen, and those most glorious ioyes in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, which you shall inherit for euermore; because hereby you shall inioy Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings more securely whilest you haue them, when as your heart is not so fixed on them but that you can bee content to leaue them; and part with them also with ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, when as you are assured, that you shall exchange them for those heauenly ioyes,
<pb facs="tcp:10731:6"/> and rich treasures of Gods glorious king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which infinitely exceede all earthly preferments in worth and excellency. Which if my poore labours, added to your better helps, and holy meditations, might any way further, I should much more reioice in being a poore instrument of your spirituall good, then in the inioying of those earthly benefits which I haue receiued from you. The Lord more and more inrich your noble heart with all spirituall and sauing grace, and after a long and happie life on earth, vouchsafe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the euerlasting fruition of his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous presence, and that fulnesse of ioy which is at his right hand for euermore.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Christian mans life is a continuall warfare, wherein hee is daily assaulted (I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with greater subtiltie or furie, policie or power) by three puissant enemies, the diuell, the the world, and the flesh; euery one of which haue many legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnder their conduct, which are ready to second and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them, when they giue signe of battaile. The diuell is the grand captaine, and generall of all these forces; the world and the flesh, are chiefe commanders vnder him, who haue many millions of spirituall enemies vnder their ensignes, that continuallie fight against vs. Satan ordereth the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and guideth all these forces to his best aduantage, and our ruine; the world ministreth vnto him weapons and munition, whereby this fight is maintained; and the flesh like a wicked traitor openeth the gates of our soules when we are assaulted, and receiuing the pay of worldly vanities, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with these externall forces to work our final ouerthrow. The issue of this fight is either their, or our victorie; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is accompanied with the diuels triumph, and our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall captiuitie and thraldome in the chaines of darknes; yea with the most exquisite and ineffable torments of hell fire: the other, with the crowne of victorie which our great Commander, the Lord of hosts, hath promised to those that<note place="margin">2.

            <p>The consideration whereof, as it should moue all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans valiantly to fight the Lords battailes, to forget all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb facs="tcp:10731:7"/> and to contemne all danger, especially seeing they haue the power of God to assist them, and his gracious promise, that if they will bee his souldiers, they shall also bee conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; if they will but fight, they shall assuredly ouercome: so also should it incite all Gods faithfull ministers, who are appointed by him to bee in this spirituall warfare, not onely souldiers, to fight in their owne persons, but also the Lords captaines to teach, guide and direct, both by word and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, those who are committed to their charge, yea as much as in them lieth the whole armie of the Church militant; that they also be carefull and diligent to teach the ignorant the Lords march, the discipline of his warre, the order of his battels, and how to manage their spirituall weapons for their best aduantage: that they likewise incourage and harten the white liuered, and freshwater souldier to the fight; that they rouze vp the sluggish, by often sounding in their eares the terrible thunder of Gods threats, and the sweet tunes of his promises; that they moderate the heate, and mitigate and restraine the desperate boldnesse of those, who are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercaried in their blind zeale, with spirituall wisdome and discretion, which are otherwise apt in themselues to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapped with the subtiltie, and to fall into the ambushments of their enemies, to their vtter ruine and destruction.</p>
            <p>Being therefore called through Gods vndeserued grace to this function, I thought it my dutie, besides my other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in my ministerie, to attempt this worke; the which I acknowledge might haue been much better atchieued by some of the Lords great Worthies, vnto the least degree of whose strength and excellencie I haue not attained: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by them either omitted, or but by the way, as some speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all occasion required, briefly touched; I thought it better, notwithstanding my great weakenesse, to vndertake it, then that it should be wholly neglected; and by doing in this the

And hauing through Gods assistance finished and set foorth the first part of this Christian War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, wherein I haue laid open the subtiltie, power, politicke stratagems, and pernicious tentations of Satan our grand enemie; and withall haue armed and furnished the weake Christian with such means and spiritual weapons, as may by the blessing and assistance of Gods holy spirit strengthen him in the incounter, repell the enemie, and obtaine victorie; and hauing found that the Work, like course meate in the time of a great dearth, hath been esteemed of many hungrie soules aboue desert, their necessitie, and not any selfe excellencie, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing worth vnto it, and making it, though in it selfe but homely fare, pleasing and acceptable to their sharpened appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites: I haue the rather bin incouraged to set vpon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of this Warfare, &amp; to arme the Christian against all those assaults, which the second enemie of our saluation, the world, assaileth him with; which as the following dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and the experience of al times sufficiently shew, are no lesse dangerous and pernicious then the other. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I hold a strange paradox in the conceit of worldly men, maintaining that these earthly things are base and of little worth, and therefore to bee contemned or lightly valued, which they so much magnifie in their iudgements, adhere vnto in their hearts and affections, and both get and keepe with so great care and labour, and lose with such bitter griefe; I thought it fit (besides my wonted order) not onely plentifully to confirme this truth by the holy Scriptures, but
<pb facs="tcp:10731:8"/> also to alleage the sayings of the godly learned, and ancient Fathers, who haue liued in former ages, to shew the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of our iudgements, and our vnanimous consent in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding those places of holy scriptures, which serue for the clearing and proouing of those points, for which I alleage them; lest perhaps mine owne writings and assertions might seeme to haue proceeded out of some melancholicke or discontented humor, which might make me to contemne the world, because it hath alwaies contemned me, and so carrie no credit with them, if I were not backed with their better authoritie. And to the same purpose, I haue also more plentifully then is my vsuall custome, alleaged the sayings of the wisest Heathens, and most learned Philosophers; because hauing to deale with carnall worldlings, who notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding make shew and profession of Christian religion, I might mooue and perswade them, if not in the feare of God, and for conscience sake, yet at least for shame to assent vnto that truth, vnto which Pagans and Infidels haue yeelded and subscribed, who haue had no other knowledge to guide them, but the light of nature. The which my labours, I humbly submit to the graue censure of the iudicious, learned, and godly Reader: the which I hope to find more fauourable; because my errours may more iustly be excused, seeing I doe not trauell in a path beaten by others, who haue gone before me, but in an vncouth and vnusuall way, where I haue not had the tract of other mens steps for my direction; there being none that I know of, especially of our countrimen, that haue purposely laboured in this argument.

                  </note> our first and chiefe enemie Satan, I haue alreadie intreated in the first part of my Christian Warfare: And now it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that being assisted with the same spirit, wee encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter also the world, which is the second enemie of our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and teach the weake Christian how he may so manage his spirituall weapons, as that he may be assured of a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant victorie. But lest whilest we fight against our enemie, wee should bend our strength against those that bee our friends, because they are intitled by the same name, let vs learne to distinguish the one from the other, and consider in what sense we are here to take the world, which is a word of ambiguous signification, and how it is to bee imbraced as a friend, and how to be auoided or withstood as a mortal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. To this purpose wee are to know, that the world in the Scriptures is sometimes taken in a good, and sometime in an<note place="margin">Act. 17. 24.</note> euill sense. In the former it sometime signifieth the whole vniuerse and goodly frame of heauen and earth, and so it is an excellent creature of Gods making, approoued as good<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>the world, and the world was made by him:</hi> and in this signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation also the world is good, sauing onely that it is defiled with mans sinne, as being the stage whereon hee acteth all his wickednesse. To this purpose one saith, that <hi>the world is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5. 19. <hi>Mundus in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligno positus, non quòd mundus ipse sit malus; sed quòd mala in mundo fiant ab hominibus, &amp;c.</hi> Hieron. in 1. ad Gallat.</note>
                  <hi>said to lie wholly in euill, not because it selfe is euill, but because euils are committed in it by men:</hi> euen as the woods are infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med when they harbour theeues, and as wee hate the sword wherewith mans blood hath bin shed, and the cup in which poyson hath been tempered, not because of any faultinesse that is in them, but because of their wickednesse who haue abused them vnto euill. Sometime the world is taken for all mankind that liueth in the world, both good and bad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer and infidell; and in this sense the Apostle saith, <hi>that by one man sinne entred into the world,</hi> that is, into all mankinde,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> who were corrupted in <hi>Adam</hi> as sinning in his loynes. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we to hate and fight against the world, being vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in this generall signification, lest wee should be found (like that currish <hi>Timon</hi>) haters of humane societie, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our owne nature. Finally, the world sometime signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the faithfull onely; not because they are of the world; for being in the world, Christ hath chosen them out of the world; but because the world was created, and is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preserued for their vse and benefit, namely, that it might serue as a place of trial, where they should be fitted for Gods kingdome, and a passage through which they might trauell into their heauenly countrey, the new Ierusalem. And in this sense it is said, that <hi>God so loued the world, that he gaue his only</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 16.</note>
                  <hi>begotten sonne, that whosoeuer beleeued in him should not perish, but haue euerlasting life.</hi> And the Apostle saith, that <hi>God was</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 19.</note>
                  <hi>in Christ and reconciled the world vnto himselfe, not imputing their sinnes vnto them.</hi> And Christ is said, to be <hi>a propitiation or reconciliation,</hi> not for the Apostles and Disciples only, <hi>but for the sinnes of the whole world,</hi> that is, for al in the world that<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 2:</note> shall beleeue in him. Now in this sense wee are not to fight against the world, seeing it is reconciled and at peace with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10731:31"/> God, nor to loath that which God so dearely loueth: yea we must loue those who are of this world, as our selues, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing subiects of Christs kingdome, and fellow members of his bodie.</p>

               <p>Somtime by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> world are signified worldly things, which Satan and wicked men vse as meanes to draw men from the seruice of God, to the seruice of sinne; whether they be allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring baits whereby they intice vnto wickednes, as pleasures,<note place="margin">1.

               <p>And sometime both these are ioyned together, in which sense the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that <hi>he was crucified to the world,</hi>

                        </gap>ence to Satan, as the prince thereof.</hi>
                  </note> it were haue singled our enemies out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of our friends; lest our loue of these should slacken and abate our zealous courage in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing against our mortall foes; or our hatred of those should make vs to dislike and hate our wel-deseruing friends. In the next place we will consider of the nature and qualitie of our enemie; and then shew his weapons and forces which hee vseth in this fight, that so wee may know the better how to auoid his furie, and to arme our selues against the encounter. And for the cleering of the former wee will briefly shew what the world is in it selfe, and then respectiuely what it is to vs. In it selfe, the Scripture saith of it, that it is euill, yea so euill, that Christ Iesus spared not to giue his owne most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 4.</note> blood, to deliuer his seruants out of this spirituall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt: and lest wee should thinke that this euill hath but a little tainted it, or that it is corrupted but in part only, the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> telleth vs, that the whole world lieth in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,<note place="margin">1. Ioh 5. 19.</note> not a little sprinkled or dipped, but sourced and sunk into a deepe and bottomlesse gulfe of sinne. The which will more manifestly appeare if wee consider that this wicked world, like a rebellious traitor, hath denied and refused to haue the Lord and great Creator of heauen and earth for his Soueraigne and King, and will not yeeld any obedience vnto his lawes and commandements, but contemneth his promises and rewards, as also his threatnings and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And contrariwise hath submitted himselfe to Satan
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10731:32"/> as his prince and gouernour, yeelding obedience vnto his will, and subiecting himselfe to be ruled by the law of sinne, for the wages of worldly vanities, as pleasures, profits, and preferments. Whereof it is that in the Scriptures the diuell is called the <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 12. 31. and 16. 11. Ephes. 2. 2.</note> prince of the world, and the <note n="b" place="margin">Ephes. 6. 12. Ephes. 2. 2.</note> gouernour ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; not because he is indeed the ruler and gouernour of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, to dispose of all at his pleasure (for this is Gods royall prerogatiue; whose slaue and vassall Satan is, and forced to doe his will when he most opposeth it) but because he ruleth in the children of disobedience, hauing them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <note n="c" place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 26.</note> readie as his deuoted bond slaues to do his will: who are called the world, because they set their hearts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions vpon it; it being the nature of loue to transforme as much as may be the louer into the nature of the thing belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and so to denominate the one according to the name of the other. Yea he not only as a king ruleth their outward actions, but also in their hearts and consciences, causing them to yeeld vnto him free, willing and absolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: and therefore he is also called the god of the world,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 4.</note> who with his mists of falsehood blindeth the eyes of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels and worldings, so as they cannot see his vglie filthines and palpable lies, nor the diuine puritie and excellencie of their Creator, and the glorious light of his truth.</p>
               <p>And as the world yeeldeth this subiection vnto Satan as<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. That the world sighteth vnder Satan against God.</hi>
                  </note> his king and soueraigne, so also it maketh choice of him for his captaine and chiefe commander, receiuing his colours and cognizance, marching vnder his conduct, and fighting vnder his standerd with like inueterate malice, both against God himselfe, and all his Church and children. Against God the world opposeth with such deadly and implicable hatred, that it is impossible for any to <note n="a" place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 15.</note> adhere vnto the world, but hee must necessarily be diuided from God; nor <note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 6. 24.</note> serue it, but hee must neglect and disobey the Lord; nor <note n="c" place="margin">Iames 4 4.</note> loue it, but God and he must be at emnitie. Neither doth it onely oppose against the diuine nature, but also against euery person of the Deitie; it rebelleth against God the Father and Creator, by refusing to serue him as his creature, but contrariwise disobeyeth his will, and desperately reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10731:33"/> all his commandements, yeelding voluntarie obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his arch-enemie the diuell; it <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 1. 11.</note> receiueth not the Sonne Iesus Christ as it Sauiour and Redeemer, but treadeth vnder foote his precious blood, and maketh but a mocke of all his sufferings, neither doth it <note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 14. 17.</note> receiue the holy Ghost the sanctifier, but checketh all his motions, and scorneth all his sanctifying and sauing graces, preferring before them worldly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For with vaine hopes as with a prosperous gale of winde, men are allured to hoyse vp the sailes of their desires, and to enter into this▪ po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10731:33"/> passage and course of worldlings, but before they can arriue at the wished hauen, they encounter a thousand desperate dangers; one while they are tossed with tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous stormes of troubles, crosses, and vexations; sometime lifted vp with their hopes, as though they should touch the heauens; sometime deiected and cast downe with feare, as though they should bee swallowed in the gulfe and (as it were) hell of despaire; now they are in danger to dash against the rockes of violence and oppression, and soone after to split their ship vpon the sands of treacherie and falsehood: sometimes they are carried into an vncouth vastnes in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to lose themselues in the bywaies of error, vnlesse fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the aduice of their skilfull Pilots, Gods messengers and Ministers, they suffer themselues to be guided and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the Card of Gods word: sometime they are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into the straits, where they are beset with perils, heere Scylla, there Charybdis, being readie to fall into the one, whilest with improuident care they auoid the other. Which being passed, their danger is not past; for though the storme, rocks and sands spare them, yet are they beset with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand wicked fiends, which like cruell pirats are readie to rob them of all those rich wares of Gods spirituall graces, and to enchaine them in their galleys of endlesse bondage. But say they are not encountred with these rough dangers of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and crosses, say that they haue a faire calme of prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and a comfortable shunshine of worldly fauours; surely howsoeuer their securitie may be much more, yet their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is not abated, yea rather it is much increased. For being thus encalmed, they haue neither power nor will to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the blessed hauen of eternall happinesse, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise being bewitched with those Syrens songs of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall-alluring pleasures, they cast themselues headlong into the gulfe of perdition, they now deuouring them which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore allured them. This danger by another is thus expressed: <hi>This world</hi> (saith he) <hi>is to Christians a dangerous sea: for as the</hi>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10731:34"/> faithfull, and with such diuersitie is this effected by the enemie, that a man can hardly know what is first to bee auoided: for if higher powers cease to oppose, it exasperateth the mindes of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men against vs; if their rage be also appeased, it setteth all on fire by those who are of a mans owne familie; and if this also be quieted, by his art hee setteth discord betweene brethren and neere kinred, that so tempestuously beating vpon the house on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the foure corners, he may on one side or other cause a ruine. For which cause it is with one consent to be fled from of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </note> if we doe consider the will and abilitie, the malice and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer thereof; which if they be in an high nature and degree ioyned together, the perill must needs be out of measure pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous.</p>
               <p>Concerning the malice of this enemie, it is exceeding great and vnreconcilable, inueterate and perpetuall. For as taking part with our arch-enemie Satan, it malitiously op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth against God, so also against all those who professe themselues his children and seruants. And as the Libbard so hateth man, that with furious malice it will flie vpon his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture or image, so this Serpents brood the world, as it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligneth God himselfe, so also with like hate it pursueth those in whom the image of God is repaired. And as with outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious malice and deadly outrage it persecuted our head Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, so with equall furie it rageth against all the true members of his bodie.

In a word, there was neuer any escaped, but assoone as they haue been friends with God, they were presently accounted the worlds enemies; and no sooner doth God receiue them into fauour, but the world pursueth them with malice and hatred.</p>
               <p>But as the world is exceeding malitious, and therefore<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 5. That the world is a subtill ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</hi> Luke 16. 8.</note> willing; so also it is very powerfull, and therefore able to hurt vs, seeing neither policie nor strength is wanting vnto it; for <hi>the children of this world are wiser in their generation then the children of the light,</hi> as the wisest of men, and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, giueth testimonie; and a thousand cunning sleights they haue to deceiue vs, and tenne thousand subtill policies to betray and circumuent vs. So that Christian wisedome which dares not exceed the bounds of simplicitie and truth, seemeth vnto them doltish sottishnes, and sillie foolishnes; and in regard of their aduantages of dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, lying, and base treacherie, it were most easie for them to ouermatch and goe beyond them, did not the Lord by his infinite wisedome and power defeate their policies, and conuert the wisedome of these <hi>Ahitophels</hi> into meere foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnes.</p>
               <p>So also it is exceeding strong both in it owne strength,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. That the world is a powerfull enemie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of it owne strength.</hi>
                  </note> and in respect of the great forces which our owne corrupt flesh doth minister vnto it. In it selfe it is so puissant, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan maketh choice of it as his chiefe champion to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs; it is his right hand wherewith he striketh vs; it is the armorie which affoordeth vnto him all those mortall weapons wherewith hee woundeth vs; it is the treasurie which yeeldeth vnto him all that wages whereby he hireth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10731:35"/> vs to offend God, and all those alluring baites wherewith he inticeth vs vnto sinne: neither could Satan hurt vs with his sharpe hookes of hellish tentations, vnlesse they were coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the sweete baites of worldly vanities; he could not get vs stoope, and intangle our selues in his nets and lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twigs of sinne and wickednesse, vnlesse he vsed stales in our owne likenes, and betraied vs by the example and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of men like vnto our selues. Thus he inticed <hi>Eue</hi> with a faire apple, the sons of God with the beautie of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men, <hi>Lot</hi> with the pleasures of Sodom, <hi>Achan</hi> with the wedge of gold, the chiefe of the Iewes with the glorie of the world: yea in these haires of worldly vanities his strength so mainly lieth, that when he was to vse all his poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and imploy all his forces, to get the victorie of the sonne of God himselfe, hee maketh choice of these worldly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and inticeth him to sinne by offering vnto him the baites of worldly necessaries, honours and preferments;<note place="margin">Matth. 4. 11.</note> with which when hee could not ouercome, hee fleeth from him as despairing of victorie. So that wee may here learne, that Satans chiefe strength consisteth in the worlds aides, and that in the conflict of tentations hee will flee, when the world cannot ouercome, as despairing of the conquest when his chiefe forces faile him.</p>
               <p>Neither doth Satan with his owne soule hands offer vnto vs these baits and bribes to allure vs vnto sinne, but hee chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth as his messengers and deputies those who are in our owne likenesse, and couered with the same flesh. He inticeth chast <hi>Ioseph</hi> to commit vncleannes, by the perswasions of his wanton Mistrisse; the Israelites to filthinesse, by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Moabites; the people of God to Idolatrie, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the cursed nations, and <hi>Salomon</hi> by his outlandish wiues. Whereby it commeth to passe that his counsailes haue more free audience, his perswasions greater authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and his gifts wherewith he allureth vs to commit sinne, are lesse suspected and mistrusted.

So that it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no arguments to perswade vs to imbrace his sinfull va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, for only the sight of them is sufficient to allure vs, our own affections more violently drawing vs, then the inticing eloquence and well framed reasons of the best perswading Oratour.<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect 8.

Neither hath this bin the case of the worlds deuoted seruants onely, but of the stoicall contemners of the world, who hauing cast downe the gauntlet of defiance, and as it were challenged to fight with it in single combat; haue at vnawares receiued foyles, in the very time of challenge, with their owne weapons, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the praise of the world by their dispraises of it, and being tickled with vaine pleasure, whilest they haue declai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med against the vanitie of pleasures; and when as by the waight of their arguments they haue ouercome their epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curish aduersaries, themselues haue been ouercome with pleasure no lesse vaine and carnall, although more subtile and refined. Yea this puissant enemie hath not only conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the heathen multitude, and ruled amongst them as an vniuersall Monarch, (for if this were all, his power were not so terrible, seeing they wanted a Captaine to guide them, spirituall eyes to direct them, and the shield of faith which might beate backe the force of the worlds furies) but not contented with his owne territories and dominions, he hath made fearefull inrodes euen into the holy land, and hath fought many fierce battels in the middest of Gods visible monarchie, vanquishing some of Gods professed seruants through their owne treacherie or cowardize, and leading them captiue to doe his will; foiling many euen of his great Worthies, through their secure negligence; and finally murthering and killing (though not ouercomming)

As soone as we are reconciled vnto God and become his seruants, we presently oppose against all those who make opposition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Lord and master, and when as wee are made his sonnes by adoption and grace, we cannot chuse in our filiall affection, but take our fathers part, breaking off all friendship with those which are his enemies, and making warre against those who fight against him▪ To this purpose the Apostle saith, that as <hi>soone as the grace of God,</hi> that is, the doctrine of<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 11. 12.</note> grace and reconciliation, <hi>doth appeare, it teacheth vs to denie vngodlines, and worldly lusts, and to liue soberly; and righteously and godly in this present world.</hi> So that the loue of the world and the loue of God, peace with the world, and peace with God, will not stand together.

As soone therefore as wee cease this fight, and become friends with the world, setting our hearts and affections more vpon worldly vanities then vpon spirituall things, we steale out of Christs campe like runnagate souldiers, we cast aside Christs liuerie, we slide back from our religion in truth, whatsoeuer wee professe in words, and ioyning in league with Christs enemie wee traiterously make warre against him.

                  </note> the world and worldly vanities, is our assured hope of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining victorie: for howsoeuer (as hath been shewed) the world is a malitious, politike, and puissant enemie, and we (being considered in our selues) are altogether vnable to make resistance, seeing our nature is weake, and our forces fraile, and which is worst of all, that weake strength we haue being diuided, and ciuill warres at home, our selues conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding against our selues, and the flesh which is our greater and stronger part, rebelling and lusting against the spirit, and traiterously ioyning with the world to worke our ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw: yet being by a liuely faith knit vnto Christ, assisted with his spirit, and armed at all points with the spirituall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of his sanctifying and sauing graces, there is no doubt of getting victorie. For we doe fight against but a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red enemie, whom Christ alreadie hath subdued, not onely for himselfe, but also for all vs that are true members of his bodie. And this argument of incouragement our Sauiour vseth, Ioh. 16. 33. <hi>In the world</hi> (saith he) <hi>ye shall haue affliction,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 33.</note>
                  <hi>but be of good comfort I haue ouercome the world.</hi> Yea this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest Christ obtained at an high rate, for he gaue his life to free vs from the worlds thraldom, as the Apostle witnesseth, Gal. 1. 4. <hi>which gaue himselfe for our sinnes, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer</hi>

And this comfort and incouragement the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Iohn</hi> giueth vs: <hi>All</hi> (saith he) <hi>that is borne of God ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the world, and this is the victorie that ouercommeth the world, euen our faith.

               <p>And these are the reasons which may incourage all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 11. How we are said to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the world, and to obtaine victorie.</hi>

In the former like a subtile <hi>Rabshakeh,</hi> in his master Satans name, hee offereth vnto vs peace, and maketh many faire promises of great plentie and securitie vnder his protection, if wee will be content to lay aside our armes, and subiect our selues as slaues and vassals vnto his gouernment. And lest these allurements might not preuaile, he mixeth threatnings, and boasteth of his great strength, whereby hee is able to ouercome by force, if fairer meanes will not perswade a yeelding; blasphemously disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the power of our mightie God, the Lord of hosts, as though he were not able so wel to prouide for vs, or to shield and defend vs against his furie. But if his bewitching elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence will not moue vs, then hee marcheth against vs with all his forces, and imployeth all his strength and policie to worke our ouerthrow; sometimes hiding the troupes of his temptations in the ambushments of worldly vanities, that is, either behind the high hils of ambitious honours, or in the low delightfull medowes of voluptuous pleasures, or else in the pricking thickets of thornie riches, that so he may assault vs in our greatest securitie, and obtaine an easie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie; and sometimes hee draweth out his forces in open view, and marcheth against vs with a terrible armie of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and persecutions, presuming to ouercome vs through force and violence. And this is the manner of the worlds fight, wherein as you see hee leaueth no meanes vnassaied to worke his owne will, and our ouerthrow: forbeing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to catch and make a pray of vs, like a cunning fisher man, he either allures vs to swallow the hookes of sin with the baits of worldly vanities; or if he cannot so preuaile, he assaieth to driue vs by force into his nets of perdition, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs forward with the slaues of trouble and affliction; or like a dangerous theefe intending to spoile vs of the rich treasures of Gods graces, either he cheateth and deceiueth vs, by perswading vs to exchange with him these precious iewels, for some counterfeite trifles and base worldly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; or if his cosening cunning preuaile not, like a strong

               <p>And thus haue I shewed how the world on euery side as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulteth vs; on the right hand with prosperitie, on the left hand with aduersitie; before vs he setteth the bewitching baits of worldly vanities, to intice vs forward in the broad way of destruction; behinde, hee pursueth vs with terrors and feares, that so we may not dare to looke backe; and if<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. That prosperitie is good in it own nature.</hi>
                  </note> we seeme but to make a stand, he whippeth vs forward with the sharp and many stringed whip of crosses and afflictions. Now let vs more specially descend to speake of the▪ worlds tentations, and of the meanes to arme our selues against them, beginning with the tentations of prosperitie, and then afterwards descending to the tentations of aduersitie. And lest wee should vndescreetly cast away the sound with the rotten, and declaime against Gods blessings, because of the worlds abuse; let vs consider what this prosperitie is, and how we are to esteeme of it in it owne nature, and how it becommeth the worlds assistant, through his abuse and our corruption, to worke our ouerthrow. Prosperitie therefore is nothing else but a confluence or concurrence of al earthly and temporall benefits; as the fauour and friendship of men, health, wealth, peace, libertie, honour, pleasure, and the like. Now if we would know how to esteeme of it, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what it is in it owne nature, and what in our vse. In it owne nature it is good, because it is the gift and blessing of God, which hee bestoweth vpon his owne seruants, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their loue and obedience. So the Psalmist saith, that <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 119. 165.</note>
                  <hi>they who loue Gods law shall haue great prosperitie, and they shall haue no hurt.</hi> And the Lord exhorteth the people of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 29. 9. and 6. 18. 2. King. 2. 3.</note>
                  <hi>to keepe the words of his couenant, that they might prosper in all that they should doe:</hi> to the same purpose are diuers
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10731:43"/> other places. The giuer therfore doth sufficiently commend the gift, and comming from him as a reward it must needes be good. Secondly, the <hi>Lord loueth and taketh</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 35. 27.</note>
                  <hi>delight in the prosperity of his seruants,</hi> as the Psalmist plainly affirmeth; and it is the good of his Saints, and not their hurt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he is so well pleased. Thirdly, prosperitie in it self is a motiue cause to make vs rēder to the Lord praises &amp; thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, and is the subiect matter of our Hymnes and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<note place="margin">Psal. 116. 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Fourthly, the seruants of God haue prayed vnto him for this prosperitie, and that both for themselues, and also for the whole Church. Of the former wee haue an example: Psal. 118. 25. <hi>O Lord I pray thee saue</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 118. 25.</note>
                  <hi>now: O Lord I pray thee giue now prosperitie.</hi> Of the other: Psal. 122. 7. <hi>Peace be within thy walles, and prosperitie within</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 122. 7.</note>
                  <hi>thy palaces.</hi> Lastly, it is made a signe of Gods fauourable presence with his seruants, and thus the Lord is said to haue <hi>been with Ioseph, for whatsoeuer he did he made it to prosper.</hi> So<note place="margin">Gen. 39. 2. 23.</note> it is said of <hi>Dauid,</hi> that he <hi>prospered and grew, for the Lord God</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And thus it appeareth that prosperitie in it selfe is good:<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. That prosperitie in respect of our vse, is of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differēt nature.</hi>

In the former respect prosperitie is good when it is enioyed by a faithful man, who being in Christ, hath recouered that right in all Gods blessings which we lost in <hi>Adam.</hi> In the other, when it commeth vnto him by lawfull meanes, as the gift and blessing of God; and being enioyed, is sanctified vnto him by the word of God and prayer: as also when as it is moderatly loued and desired, with a willingnes to hold it, as long as God will, and wee may by lawfull meanes; and with contentednes to leaue it, when it pleaseth God to take<note place="margin">Iob 1. 21.</note> it from vs. Finally, it is good when as it is vsed and imployed for the aduancement of Gods glorie, who is the fountaine

And if any such enioy prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and thus vse it, in this manner, and to these ends, it is to bee accounted vnto them Gods singular blessing, and as a temporall pledge of eternall happinesse. But contrariwise, prosperitie is euill to the wicked and vnregenerate, who haue no right vnto Gods creatures, as also when it is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully compassed, and naughtily vsed, as when it is immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately loued and desired, namely, aboue God, his heauenly blessings, and spirituall graces: for as one saith, <hi>it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence</hi>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10731:44"/> concupiscence and sinne. Vnto which abuse we are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceeding prone: for as fruite is vnto a childe, libertie to the licentious, cockring loue to an vndutiful sonne, a sword to a mad man, beautie to the lasciuious, and good drinke to a filthie drunkard, such is worldly prosperitie vnto vs. And hence it is that the Lord like a wise Physition (feeling our pulse, and finding that our nature inclineth vs to this pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risie of prosperitie, whereby our braines are so intoxicated, as wee forget God and all goodnesse) doth purposely la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to preuent it, and maketh wholesome preseruatiues of admonitions to keepe vs from it, in many places of holie Scriptures, as hereafter we shall see.

The danger of worldly prosperitie is exceeding<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> great; for as by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> rule the height of health is the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:10731:45"/> first degree to some dangerous sicknesse; so when our world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly estate seemeth most healthie, strong, and vigorous, then is our corrupt nature prone to fall into the perillous diseases of sinne, which are attended vpon with eternall death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. And therefore the wise man saith, <hi>that ease slaieth the floolish, and the prosperitie of fooles destroyeth them.</hi> Where<note place="margin">Prou. 1. 32.</note> by fooles hee vnderstandeth sinners and wicked men, who abuse their prosperitie, by setting their hearts vpon it, louing and trusting in it more then in God, and strengthening themselues thereby to commit all manner of sinne and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse. So that worldly men enioying prosperitie, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all their delight and felicitie in it, are not vnfitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the little infant, who sitteth at the hole of the Aspe, and plaieth with the Cockatrice, whose pastime is their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, and their pleasure death. Or like the childe playing with the fire; who no sooner toucheth it with his finger but is burnt, and changeth his sport into teares and crying; sauing that herein they are much more foolish then little children, for they feeling the smart doe euer after dread the fire; but these being often burned with the bright shining flames of worldly prosperitie, are not warned, nor made more warie by their owne harmes, but as being besotted in their loue, they still imbrace their ruine, and hunt after that which most hurteth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And so doth the doting loue of these fond worldlings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue them not onely of all religion, but also of the vse of reason; yea it so stupifieth the senses that they are deafe to all admonition; insensible of their owne smart, and in no possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of being ruled, and gouerned, ordered, or contained by any law: in which respect <hi>Chrysostome</hi> compareth them to such a man, as dwelling with a faire maid whom he fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Matth. 12. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 41.</note> affecteth, is by strict order inioyned, that hee presume not to looke vpon her with lasciuious and wanton glances; a thing to him no lesse vnpleasant then impossible.</p>

                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:10731:45"/> plainly appeare, if wee doe but consider, how farre it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth<note place="margin">That the state of prosperitie is much more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous then the state of aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie.</note> the danger of the state opposed thereunto, aduersitie and affliction. For whereas affliction being an open enemie, terrible in appearance, and making shew at the first sight of all his forces, and sometimes of more then he hath, setting before vs shadowes, in stead of substantiall enemies, doth make vs more carefull and watchfull to prepare and arme our selues, that wee may make resistance: Prosperitie is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret traitor, which hideth hatred and hostilitie, vnder the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of loue and friendship, and thereby maketh vs so retchlesse and secure, that in stead of opposition, wee are readie to receiue this serpent into our bosome, and when he incountreth vs with all his forces, so bewitched we are with the pleasing sight of this glorious enemie, that we cleere all the passages, and set wide open the gates of our soules, to giue him entertainment, voluntarily offering our selues to digge in his mines, and in most slauish manner to row in his galleys, so as we may be assured to enioy his companie. And the reason hereof is, because hee deceiueth vs with his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie: for at his first comming he displaieth not his bloody ensigne, but setteth vp a flagge of friendship, hee assaulteth vs not with open force and violence, nor marcheth against vs in a terrible and hostile manner, but like a subtile serpent he cunningly glideth and insinuateth himself into our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie; neither doth he as a martiall enemie strike at vs with downe right blowes, but rather like a craftie witch he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotteth vs with his pleasing charmes, and with cunning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments before he conquereth vs, he maketh vs willing to be ouercome. He doth incline, and not constraine, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, and not ouercome, or rather ouercommeth by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading, and most forcibly constraineth by mouing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining. He doth not vse against vs any outward terrible forces when hee doth besiege vs, but (<hi>Sinon</hi> like) with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching eloquence, and counterfeit gifts, hee allureth vs to breake downe the walles of our strength, and with our own hands to make a cleere passage for our owne ouerthrow. He doth not when hee commeth to execution, vse the dreadfull sword, but rather sweete and well-tasting poysons, which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10731:46"/> hurt with delight, and whilest they seeme to nourish, cast vs into a lethargie or dead sleepe of deepe securitie. Finally, he inflicteth on vs no griefly wounds, nor bringeth vs to our end by a foule death; but as it were tickleth vs to death with inueigling pleasures, making vs most to laugh when wee are most tormented, and in a chariot of gold, strawed with roses, he swiftly carrieth vs into hell.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore learne to contemne and hate the world<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. That we are most carefully to take heed of the world when it fawneth on vs.</hi>
                  </note> our wicked enemie, as well when hee fawneth as when hee frowneth, when he allureth by flatterie and deceit, as when hee constraineth by force and violence: for though hee be then more amiable in view, yet is hee no lesse malitious in truth; and because hee is then lesse suspected, hee is much more dangerous, as hauing better opportunitie to vse all his forces, and to effect all his malitious designes. Why then, alas, should wee giue eare to the worlds flatteries? why should we beleeue this dissembling <hi>Ioab</hi> who will mortally stab vs, whilest hee professeth friendship, and offereth in kindnesse to embrace and kisse vs? why should wee listen to this sweete singing Syren, seeing he bewitcheth in deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and maketh vs leape into the sea of destruction? why should his flattering perswasions, ioyned with crocadile teares, moue vs, seeing he either weepeth for ioy to think on his pray, or for spite because his hopes are so long deferred? why should the glorious beautie of his golden cup allure vs, seeing we know that the potion within it is full of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poyson, which whosoeuer drinke shall eternally perish? why should we be moued with his inticing gifts to admire his kindnes, seeing by these baites he allureth vs to swallow the hookes of sinne, and offereth these carnall toyes and earthly trifles, no lesse vaine in themselues, then momentany in their continuance, that he may cosen vs in the exchange, mouing vs to giue for them the precious iewels of Gods graces, and our heauenly patrimonie in his kingdome.

And as it staieth our course in godlines, and quencheth our vertues, so also it increaseth our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, corrupteth our manners, and maketh vs prone to fall into all sinne, if we be but a little rouched with the least ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And as the fertill soile being more fat and slipperie, is apter to giue a fall to those that walke vpon it, then that which is grauellie and barren; so this rich and fruitfull ground of prosperitie is much more slipperie, then the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren heaths of aduersitie and affliction, and not one of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand doth goe long vpon it, but hee catcheth many down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falles, not only into sinne. but also into danger and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which border fast vpon it.

For how difficult, and almost impossible it is to walke in this sunshine of prosperitie and not be tanned, to breathe this infected aire and not to bee corrupted with noisome and carnall lusts, it is euident, both on the one side, by the huge multitudes of those who in abusing it, haue bin abused by it; and on the other side, by the exceeding raritie and paucitie of those, who by the good vse thereof, haue bin made more vertuous, and better fitted for the seruice of God. For if you take a computation of both, you shall finde a greater disparitie betweene them in their number, then betweene the seruants of God and the seruants of <hi>Baal,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Elias</hi> account; the one exceeding the starres in multitude, the other being as rare as black swans, vnlesse we
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:10731:48"/> will reckon of some sew, who had their prosperitie tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a great measure of affliction, which as an antidote expelled the poyson of the other, and like a cold frost nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their rancknes, made them to become more fruitfull. How many haue we read and heard of, that haue valiantly resisted the assaults of aduersitie, and haue patiently endured pouertie, and that which is worse, losse of wealth, sicknesse and diseases, banishment, and imprisonment, yea death it self, and horrible tortures, much worse then death? But shew me enow to intitle a number, of those who haue by worldly prosperitie, riches, honours, and pleasures, been made more religious and zealous in Gods seruice, more vertuous, wise, humble, temperate, and more carefull &amp; watchful ouer their waies, that they might not offend God the author of their welfare. Yea shew me almost y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> man, that hath not by world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prosperitie bin made worse, more forgetfull of God, more negligent in Christian duties, &amp; vicious in his whole course and conuersation. Whereas contrariwise a whole age were too little to reckon vp those who haue come out of the fire of affliction more purified, profited vnder this schoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and by these fatherly chastisements haue increased in their loue towards God, and in their care to please him by their holie obedience.</p>
               <p>Yea let vs if you will obserue the same men, and you shall<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. The great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the same men in prosperitie and aduersitie.</hi> 1. Sam. 10. 22.</note> see them not the same, but exceedingly differing from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in these different estates: look vpon <hi>Saul</hi> in his meane condition, and you shall see him modestly hiding himselfe, as vnworthie to be King; but being once seated in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> throne, and swelled with drinking this royall poyson, how proud he is and insolent, disobedient and rebellious, louing his kingdome better then his God, and against his knowledge and conscience, making warre with heauen, rather then hee would not haue it continued to him and his posteritie, though he were iustly deposed for his sinne. See also how in the entrance into his raigne he spareth his enemies, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth<note place="margin">1. Sam. 11. 13.</note> offenders from deserued punishments, but afterwards with deadly and implacable malice persecuteth his friends,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 22. 17.</note> and tyrannically murthereth the guiltlesse and innocent.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10731:48"/> But if worldly prosperitie were only powerfull with wicked worldlings, it were no great wonder: see therefore how it hath also preuailed against Gods Saints. Behold holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> who in his afflicted estate exceeded all in pietie, and was esteemed by God worthie that praise, to bee pronounced a man according to Gods owne heart; how foully hee was foiled with ease and prosperitie, and after many famous vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, now enioying secure peace, was assaulted and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished with his owne lusts. See here his great humilitie, comparing himselfe to a dead dogge and a flea; and there<note place="margin">1. Sam. 24. 15.</note> (not content with the royalties of a kingdome, vnlesse hee knew ouer how many hee commanded) enioyning, yea for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, in pride of heart, his seruant <hi>Ioab</hi> to number the people. In this consider his tendernesse and pious mercie, sauing his enemie when hee had him in his power, his conscience checking him for cutting the lap of his garment, when hee spared his throate; but in that, murthering his faithfull and well deseruing souldier, for no other fault but because his wife was too beautifull for a subiect, yea rather then hee<note place="margin">1. Sam. 11.</note> would not haue him dispatched, adioyning others of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent seruants in the cruell massacre. Which bloodie sinne hee was now able to disgest without remorce for a long space, and stifly to stand vnder this intollerable waight, who<note place="margin">Psal. 38. 6.</note> before was very crooked with the farre lighter burthen of his infirmities. So looke vpon <hi>Ezechiah</hi> in his bed of sicknes, and there you shall see him humbling himselfe before God, and praying; and then behold him being recouered to his health, and you shall finde him glorying in his wealth, and in pride of heart boasting of his treasures.</p>
               <p>And if these single victories ouer these great Worthies do<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 7. That prosperitie hath corrupted and destroyed whole nations.</hi>
                  </note> not sufficiently shew the strength of this enemie; see what conquests this worldly prosperitie hath made of whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and to say nothing of heathenish people, nor of the foure great Monarchies, who hauing conquered all others, were themselues ouercome by their prosperitie, which first made them licentious in all manner of sinne, and afterwards slaues to their conquered enemies; looke vpon the Israel of God, in the whole time of the Iudges and Kings, and you
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10731:49"/> shal see them in the time of aduersitie, religious and deuout, forsaking their sinnes and seeking the Lord; but being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored and repossessed of Gods blessings, and florishing in prosperitie, you shall finde them polluting Gos house, ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting idolatrie, forsaking God, and worshipping diuels. And this good <hi>Ezra</hi> obserued and confessed, namely, that the people hauing obtained but a little breathing time from<note place="margin">Ezra 9. 8. 10.</note> their afflictions, did take occasion thereby to forsake Gods commandements. And <hi>Nehemiah</hi> acknowledgeth that the people abounding wth all plentie did eate, fill themselues, and became fat, and then grew rebellious and disobedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But vnto the experience of ancient ages, wee may adde<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 8. The danger of prosperitie she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of these present times.</hi>
                  </note> our owne times: for who seeth not that commonly where there is most affliction, there is also most deuotion, religion, and obedience? and contrariwise where there is prosperitie and plentie of all things, there is most want of the feare of God, and greatest penurie of grace and vertue. For the clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this, compare the prison with the Court, and the house of mourning with the house of feasting and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; and whereas in the one you shall heare religious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, prayers to God, and inuectiues against the worlds vanities; in the other you shall finde nothing but riot and ribauldrie, vaine iesting and blasphemous swearing, surfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drunkennes, chambring and wantonnes, audacious boldnes in euill, and shamefastnes in nothing, vnlesse at vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, being among their wicked consorts, they haue said or done something that sauoureth of religion, as though there were neither God, nor diuell, heauen, nor hell, and as though they had sold themselues vnto sinne, and had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed the eternall ioyes of Gods kingdome, with the temporarie vanities of the world. But lest this dissimilitude of behauiour should seeme to arise from the difference of the persons, and not of their estates, let vs consider the diuers
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10731:49"/> effects of these two estates in the same men. And leauing worldlings to the world, who seeth not that those who make profession of religion, are exceedingly cooled in their zeale, and corrupted in their liues and conuersation, through the prosperitie of the world? and that not only counterfeit Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, but euen such as in their meaner and more poore estate, would rather haue suffered any persecution, euen to the taking away of their liues, then they would disgrace their profession by offering any scandall, or bee drawne to slacken their pace in the way of godlinesse, are by degrees so carried away with the inticing baites of prosperitie, that first they abate of their heate, and afterwards become luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme, or keycold in their religious profession and practise? And howsoeuer they retaine still the name of Christians, lest they should bee branded with that dreadfull badge of apostasie, yet come to the touchstone of their liues, and to their carriage and demeanour in their particular places and callings, and you shall finde many of them, as worldly, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and niggardly in contributing to religious and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vses, yea as proud and vaine in apparell, as deceitfull in their dealings, and riotous in needlesse and idle expenses, as professed worldlings. So that whereas aduersitie could not foile them with his sharpest incounters, when hee purposely bent all his forces against them; prosperitie hath subdued them, and made them captiues to the world, as it were in play, taking no great paines to obtaine the conquest.</p>
               <p>Now the reasons why wee are so easily foiled and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 9. The reasons why prosperitie is so dangerous▪</hi>
                  </note> by worldly prosperitie, are, because it doth soften and effeminate our mindes, so as they can indure no labour, nor sustaine the least force and violence: for as the lute string being softned in water swelleth much in bignes, but loseth all his strength; so our hearts being moistned and mollified with these waters of prosperitie, exceedingly swell in pride, but in the meane time lose all their strength and Christian fortitude, so as they cannot indure the least incounter of an enemie. Or else it is because it maketh vs retchlesse and secure, so as we fearing no assault neuer muster vp our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that we may haue them in a readinesse, and so being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10731:50"/> at vnawares, and vnprouided, we are not able to stand or make resistance: for whereas the cold of aduersitie gathers and vnites all the powers of the soule, and by vertue of this vnion inables them to make resistance, when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred, so the heate of prosperitie dissipating and scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, maketh them much more easie to be ouercome. Or which is most probable, because prosperitie puffeth men vp with pride, and making them leaue their dependancie on God, causeth them to trust in themselues and their owne strength; and so God resisteth them in their pride and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saketh them, who had first forsaken him: and therefore no maruell it is if being left of God, they be easilier ouercome of the weakest enemie. Whereas contrariwise affliction ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs flee vnto God for helpe, and distrusting in our selues to relie on his power and promises; and so though we haue to deale with a mightie enemie, yet being shrouded vnder the shadow of his wings, we become safe through his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I manifested the great power of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 10. That a great measure of grace is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the well managing of our prosperitie.</hi>

Whereby it appeareth, that a farre greater measure of grace and Christian resolution is required, to beare and resist the encounters of worldly prosperitie, then of the other which seemeth to flesh and blood so terrible and vnresistable. For as it is much more intollerable to indure a tickling itch then a smarting paine; so it is much more impossible to retaine a Christian constancie in the course of godlinesse, when the world tickleth vs with this itch of prosperitie, then when wee feele the smart and paine of troubles and afflictions;<note place="margin">Vbi plus sortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae licentia, ibi plus virtutis negotium.</note>

Now if wee would know how to fight against this enemie, where our chiefe strength lieth, and what are the best weapons to be vsed for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of victorie, wee must consider that the Christian champion must not vndertake this combat, nor enter the lists in his owne name, but (as <hi>Dauid</hi> against <hi>Goliah</hi>) we must come out against him in the name of the Lord; we must not relie vpon our owne strength, but vpon the Lords assistance, and vpon the power of his might, through which alone we are inabled to ouercome; neither must our comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence be grounded vpon any conceit, that wee are able in our selues to subdue this enemie, but in this, that our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Iesus Christ hath ouercome him for vs. And this must<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 33.</note> make vs to flie vnto him by earnest and effectuall prayer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring the helpe and assistance of his holy spirit, whereby we may bee deliuered in the day of tentation, and may haue these worldly lusts killed and crucified in vs.</p>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:10731:51"/> Gods sanctifying spirit. And being armed, we must obserue the best maner of fight for obtaining the victorie: to which purpose let vs know, that wee proclaime warre against pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie and worldly vanities, and manfully resist in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat of tentations; when wee thrust them out from hauing a chiefe place in our hearts, making them as slaues to follow and obey vs, and not as Lords to rule and raigne ouer vs. When as wanting them, wee doe not greatly desire their companie, much lesse vse wicked and vnlawfull meanes, for the obtaining of this vnprofitable societie. When as hauing them we do not set our hearts vpon them, but esteeme them base and contemptible, in comparison of the rich iewels of Gods graces, &amp; the eternal ioies of his kingdom; being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to lose thē, rather then in the least degree to hazard the other. And when wee immoderatly grieue not, but rest well contented, if it bee the pleasure of God to take them from vs; yea when wee our selues can willingly cast them away for Christ sake, and renounce and forsake them, when as they will not stand with our profession and practise of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; being content to leaue all the worlds glorie, and to take vp our crosse and follow Christ. In a word, wee fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst worldly prosperitie, when we defie it; we kill it, when we contemne it; we obtaine the victorie when we flee from it, and renounce it; as often as it is the diuels solicitour to perswade vs vnto sinne, or a corriuall with God or his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wooing vs for our hearts; or an alluring baite which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeth vs to swallow the hooke of tentations, and to giue entertainment to the wicked suggestions of the diuell.</p>

For as the Moone being in the full, is furthest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the Sunne, from whom she receiueth her light and brightnes; so when we are in the full of prosperitie, we are furthest off from God the author and fountaine of all our good.

               <p>Secondly, let vs know that the meane estate is much to be<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sest. 2. The meane e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state is to be preferred before great prosperity.</hi>

Againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is none so good and holy, but they are blotted and stained with infirmities and imperfections: therefore the Lord being infinit in iustice, doth not only punish these sins in his owne deare Sonne, but doth also chastise and correct his faithfull seruants themselues, that they may be examples of his righteous iudgements, and teach wicked worldlings what they are to expect for their trayterous rebellion, and outragious sinnes, when as Gods faithfull seruants and deare children, are so sharpely afflicted for their slips and smaller faults, which haue been alreadie fully punished in their Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.<note place="margin">Ierem. 25. 29.</note> O that this were but well considered, and then would worldlings haue little cause to be puffed vp with pride, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they exceed others in worldly pompe and prosperitie: then would all (who are not extreamely secure) when they are greatly aduanced in their worldly estate, carefully take heed that their spirituall estate be not as much impaired, and feare lest this temporal prosperitie be al the portion that euer they shall receiue: then would not those who want these earthly benefits immoderatly desire them, and so vse vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes to attaine vnto them, but would rest contented with their small pittance and shortallowance, hopefully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to receiue their portion in the life to come: then would not those that haue them, set their hearts vpon them, but would willingly part with them to good vses, that in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change they might haue the assurance of Gods loue, and their owne saluation, more certainly confirmed vnto them.

               <p>Lastly, let vs consider that worldly prosperitie immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately loued, or otherwise abused, not only depriueth vs of our portion in our heauenly inheritance, but also procureth a

Now if we would also remember how proue we are to this abuse (as before I haue shewed) there would be little reason, why we should greatly desire this worldly prosperitie, if wee haue it not, or not feare it when we haue it, and much lesse that we should take more paines for the obtaining of it, then the rich treasures of Gods kingdome; or set our hearts vpon it with more feruent loue, being both base, momentanie and dangerous, then vpon those heauenly &amp; eternall ioyes which are prepared for vs in the world to come. And thus much shal suffice for those argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which may generally perswade vs to cōtemne world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prosperitie, comming in comparison with spirituall and heauenly things, and to flie and renounce it, when it is vsed as the diuels, or the worlds baite to allure vs vnto sinne: vnto which many more might be added; but that I reserue them, and the more full and effectuall vrging of this point, till I come to speake of the contempt of the chiefe parts of this prosperitie, namely the honors, riches and pleasures of the world.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:10731:55"/> which they arise; for they are either inward, and in our selues; or outward in some externall worldly obiect. The inward either arise from some thing in our soules, or in our bodies; the tentations of the former kinde respect, either vertues, or some other gifts and ornaments of the soule. By vertues I vnderstand not those which are truly religious graces and holy duties ioyned with the knowledge, loue, and feare of God; but those morall, ethicall and ciuill ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which are in a man vnregenerate before his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which may well be reckoned as parts of worldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie, seeing there is no earthly comfort, nor worldly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse without them. The which in this discourse I purpose not to take strictly, but to comprehend vnder this name the facu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they are good, as Gods gifts, and in their owne nature, yet they are not good in vs, because they are imperfect and mingled with corruption, nor good to vs, because Satan, the world, and our own sinfull flesh abusing them, do raise out of thē a most dangerous tentation; namely, that because they excell all other worldly things, and wee excell in them the ordinarie sort of men, therefore wee must so dote on them, and ouerweene their worth, as though our chiefe happines consisted in them, neglecting in the meane time all sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing graces as needlesse, because these morall and ciuill ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues were sufficient for our saluation. And thus the whole sect of the Stoicks were abused &amp; deluded in ancient times, and herewith the Papists in our owne times are (though not quite blinded, yet) shrewdly bleered; and amongst our selues many worldlings, and vnregenerate men, are pitifully

And these either respect the persons indued with these vertues, and doing these duties, or the ground and foundation whereon they are built, and the fountaine whence they flow, or else the ends which are chiefly and mainly propounded to them. First for the person it is required, that he who is to do a good action be ingrafted into Christ Iesus, and be a true and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly member of his bodie; for vnlesse we be in him, we cannot bring foorth any fruites of vertue or Christian duties; as himselfe plainly telleth vs: <hi>Abide</hi> (saith he) <hi>in me and I in</hi>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10731:56"/> ye are the branches: he that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing.</hi> So the Apostle saith, that <hi>wee are Gods workmanship created in</hi>

                  <hi>Christ Iesus vnto good workes.</hi> It is therefore the roote Iesus Christ from which we sucke the sap of vertue and goodnesse whereby we liue, and bring forth the fruits of godlines. It is this Sunne of righteousnes, from which we borrow all our light of grace and vertue: for whatsoeuer goodnesse there is in vs, it is either his inherent righteousnes and holines impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and belonging vnto vs, as being members of his bodie; or else wrought in vs by his Spirit of sanctification dwelling in vs, which also we haue by vertue of that vnion which is betweene vs and him.

So that a man laboureth in vaine to attaine vnto ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, if he thinke they may be hoped for elsewhere, then from the Lord of vertue, &amp;c.</hi> Againe, the person being in Christ, must through faith in him bee reconciled vnto God; for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son must bee accepted before the vertue or dutie can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable; it being otherwise impossible that the actions of an enemie should be well esteemed by him to whom hee is an enemie, especially when many iust exceptions may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against them. Now we are all naturally before wee are ingrafted into Christ by faith the children of wrath, and<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 3. Rom. 5. 10.

Finally, before wee can bring foorth any good fruites of vertue, and holy duties, it is necessarie that we be first regenerate and sanctified with his spirit, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:10731:56"/> our hearts must be purified by faith, before they can worke<note place="margin">Act. 15. 9.

For without this neither our persons, nor workes are accepted of God: not our persons, because we are enemies, vntill by Christ we be reconciled; not our vertues, duties and workes, because they are imperfect and stained with our corruptions, and therfore they cannot indure the sight of Gods iustice, till their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection bee couered with Christs perfect righteousnes, and their pollution cleansed and washed away with his most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood.

And to conclude, when they are most iustified in the world, they are in the state of death and condemnation; for the Apostle saith, that all, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>shall be damned which beleeue not the truth;</hi> which doome<note place="margin">2.

For if a man doth any thing, wherein he seemeth not to sinne, if he doth it not for that end which he ought, he is conuinced of sinne; for true vertues, in men serue God, from whom they haue receiued them. And whatsoeuer good is done of man, and is not done for that for which true wisedome teacheth vs it ought to be done, although in the dutie it selfe it may seeme good, yet the end being not right, it is a sinne. And therefore some good things may be done, and they not doe well of whom they are done, &amp;c.</hi> For it is vniust and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious to make vice the end of vertue, and to enforce it basely to serue our voluptuous, couetous, &amp; ambitious lusts.

                  <hi>glorie, honour, and soueraigntie, which good men did desire, and indeuoured to compasse by good meanes, but they ought to waite vpon vertue: for that is not true vertue, which doth not tend to that end, which is the chiefe good of man, before which nothing is to be preferred.</hi> The which end if wee leaue, and aime at our owne glorie and praise, though our vertues and actions in themselues be neuer so excellent, yet they are but hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and shall (as our Sauiour saith) haue no other reward from God but the reward of hypocrites, the glorie of the<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 1. 2.</note> world and praise of men.</p>
               <p>And these are the conditions which giue vnto all vertue<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 11. That world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in their ciuill vertues and workes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue none of the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</hi>

To say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of those who cast God out of their hearts, and set vp
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:10731:60"/> the idoll of the world, honours, pleasures and riches, which they serue in the place of God. So also their morall vertues and ciuill honestie, are not ioyned with pietie, and the true feare of God; for howsoeuer these worldlings seeme to make some conscience of their dealings with men, and to carrie themselues iustly in the world, keeping their fidelitie in their words and promises, yet they haue no care of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their dutie towards God, but contemne his seruice, neglect the vertues of the first table, which respect God, make no account of blasphemie and cursed swearing, nor of neglecting and prophaning his holy Sabbaths. Neither do<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22.</note> they embrace these vertues, nor performe these duties in loue towards God, (for true charitie is a fruite of the spirit, and they are fleshly and carnall) but for selfe loue, that they may the better atchieue their worldly desires. Neither are they ioyned with the true knowledge of God and his will, seeing they remaine vtterly ignorant, euen of the very prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of religion, hauing only the small glimse of the light of nature to guide them, and their owne good meaning and blind deuotion to prick them forward. And therefore wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting sauing knowledge, of necessitie they be also destitute of a liuely and iustifying faith; for before we can come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by faith, we must first know that God is, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently their vertues and duties wanting faith, to apply vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them Christs righteousnes to couer them, and his blood to purge them, do lie open to the eie of Gods iustice, in their naturall filthinesse and pollution. Neither can they obserue the Apostles conditions of doing these duties with a pure heart and a good conscience; for it is <hi>faith that purifieth the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 15. 9.</note>
                  <hi>heart,</hi> and it is <hi>the blood of Christ,</hi> applied by faith, <hi>that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth our consciences from dead workes, and enableth to serue the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note>
                  <hi>liuing God.</hi> So also they doe not embrace these vertues, and doe these duties, in obedience to God, because he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, but either for feare of men, or to gaine credit, or auoide shame, or else the better to attaine vnto their worldly ends. They are not ioyned with humilitie; for as pride first is the Vsher that bringeth them in, and giueth them intertainment; so being intertained they increase
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10731:60"/> their pride, making them to haue an high conceit of their<note place="margin">Luke 18. 11.</note> owne worth, and in comparison of themselues, to contemne all others, as wee may see in the example of the proud Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. Finally, these ciuill worldlings doe not propound to themselues Gods glorie, as the end of all their vertues and duties, but their owne profit and vaine glorie; as appeareth in the practise of the Romanes, who placed the temple of vertue, and temple of honour together, because they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to themselues honour for the end of their vertue,<note place="margin">August. de Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit.

               <p>Seeing therefore there is no worth or excellencie in these<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 12. That we are to contemne ciuill vertues, and to hunger after Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes.</hi>
                  </note> morall ciuill vertues, and duties of worldlings, and seeing they doe not tend to the aduancement of Gods glorie, nor further the saluation of our owne soules; yea seeing they are no better in Gods esteeme, but filthie sinnes which are guilded ouer with a glosse of vertue, &amp; are so far from set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs forward in the true way to heauen, that they are the matter and ground of a dangerous and pernicious tentation of Satan and the world, whereby they destroy the soules of innumerable multitudes, by perswading them to rest in this morall vertue, and ciuill honestie, as sufficient for their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; and so to sleepe securely in their sinnes, vtterly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting true repentance, and sound conuersion vnto God, and al the meanes of obtaining a liuely faith in Iesus Christ, whereby they might be iustified before God, sanctified, and saued: therefore seeing it is not only base in value, but also pernicious in his effects; let no worldling hereafter set his heart on it, and be puffed vp in pride because herein hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth others; but as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> contemned his legall righteousnes, though hee had obtained to such perfection therein, that <hi>he was vnrebukeable, counting it for Christs sake,

                  </note> and ciuil vertues are to be cōtemned, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of Gods spiritual graces, as being the ground of a most dangerous tentation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our eternall good and saluation are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly hindered; the truth wherof might further be shewed and exempled, by taking a view of all the speciall vertues comprehended vnder the general. But because this would be ouer long; &amp; besides, it is very easie for any to fit that which hath been generally spoken, to the specials, I will only insist in one particular, namely, worldly and carnall wisedome,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10731:61"/> wherewith many are bewitched with ouer much cunning, cozening themselues both of Gods grace and their owne saluation. And lest for want of distinct knowledge, we should contemne the good with the bad: I will first shew what kinds of wisdome are warrantable and commendable, that so we may the better vnderstand what that is which is worldly, wicked, and to be condemned: and afterwards I will set downe some reasons to perswade all Christians to contemne and hate it. For the former, we are to vnderstand, that wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is either diuine and spirituall, or else morall and ciuill. Diuine and spirituall wisdome is a gift and grace of Gods Spirit, bestowed only vpon the elect and faithfull, whereby we know God and his will reuealed in his word, and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conscionablie make a holy vse of this knowledge in our liues and conuersations: where I call it Diuine, because God only is truly wise, and the fountaine of wisdome, from<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 27.</note> whom those little streames, and small drops which are in vs, doe flow and distill: where also I distinguish it from that which is diabolicall, euen the deceitfull wisdome of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till serpent. And I say that it is spirituall, not only because it proceedeth from the Spirit of God, but because it is also chiefly exercised in spirituall and heauenly things. This wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is the gift of God: for as <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>With him is wisdome</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 12. 13. 16.</note>

                  <hi>there is a spirit in man, yet the inspiration of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie giueth vnderstanding.</hi> And <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, that <hi>the Lord gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth</hi>

                  <hi>commeth of the Lord, and hath been euer with him, and is with him for euer.</hi> Now this wisdome the Lord giueth by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and therefore the <hi>Spirit of God is called the Spirit of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esay 11. 2.</note>
                  <hi>and vnderstanding, the Spirit of counsell and strength, the Spirit of knowledge and of the feare of the Lord:</hi> and he giueth it not vnto all, but vnto his elect and faithfull seruants alone, <hi>who are good in his sight,</hi> as the Wise man speaketh. To which<note place="margin">Eccles. 2. 26.</note> purpose the sonne of <hi>Syrach,</hi> speaking in the person of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, saith thus: <hi>The Creator of all things gaue me a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 24. 11.</note>
                  <hi>and he that made me, appointed me a tabernacle, &amp; said,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:10731:62"/> let thy dwelling be in Iacob, and take thine inheritance in Israel, and root thy selfe among my chosen.</hi> And lastly by the Author this spirituall wisdome is distinguished, from that worldly and carnall wisdome, which is inspired by the wicked spirit, the subtile world and our owne corrupt flesh.</p>
               <p>Now this diuine and spirituall wisdome doth consist in<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. Wherein spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall wisdome consisteth.</hi>
                  </note> our knowledge of God, and of his will, and in a holy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereunto, in the whole course of our liues; for it is partly speculatiue and in contemplation, and partly practicall and in operation: the former is vsually called spirituall wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whereby out of Gods word we know generally what is truth, and what is falsehood, what is good, and what is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill; and answerablie in our iudgements approue and chuse the one, and condemne and refuse the other: the latter is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led spiritual prudence, whereby we are able to bring the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer into vse vpon euery speciall occasion, putting difference betweene truth and falsehood, good and euill, chusing the one and refusing the other, according to those diuers cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, of persons, times, places, meanes and ends. So that the former is exercised in things generall and necessary, shewing what is lawfull, and what vnlawfull in it selfe; the other in things speciall and contingent, shewing what is fit and conuenient, and what vnfit and inconuenient in respect of circumstāces: which difference the Apostle maketh, where speaking of things indifferent, he saith, that <hi>all things were</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 12.</note>
                  <hi>lawfull vnto him, but not all things profitable or expedient.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>consist in the operations of vertue.</hi> But when this wisdome and obedience are ioyned together, then are we truly said to haue attained vnto spirituall wisdom, whereby as our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are informed, so also are our affections sanctified, and our liues reformed and amended. And hereof it is that true wisedome is said in the Scriptures to consist in the feare of God; <hi>The feare of the Lord is wisdome, and to depart from euill</hi>

                  <hi>the Lord, all they that obserue them haue good vnderstanding, his praise endureth for euer.</hi> Because, where the true feare of God is, it will make those who are indued therewith, to labour after the knowledge of Gods will, that knowing what is pleasing vnto him, they may imbrace it, and what displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, that they may auoid it: and for as much as they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in his sight, it will cause them awfully to demeane themselues as in his presence, obseruing his will, and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding obedience to all his Commandements. And thus the Prophet ioyneth these together, saying, that <hi>the Spirit of the</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd so much concerning diuine and spirituall<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 1. Of ciuill wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and of the cautions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto required, that it may be good and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>
                  </note> wisedome: Ciuill and morall wisedome is a common gift of Gods spirit bestowed on man, whereby the vnderstanding being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, hee is able to iudge and discerne, what is truth, and what falsehood, what good, and what euill in humane and worldly affaires, that being hereby gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and directed, hee may wisely and discreetly manage all his words and actions, especially in those businesses which more properly respect his place and calling. And this wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is in it owne nature good, as being the gift of God, bestowed vpon mankinde, to a good end, namely that hee may the better be inabled to performe all duties of his place and calling. And howsoeuer it is not to be esteemed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of diuine and spirituall wisedome, yet if wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with any worldly and temporall gifts of God, the highest place of excellencie is due vnto it: whereof it is that <hi>Salomon</hi> being put to his choice what hee would haue of<note place="margin">1. King. 1. 9. 10.</note> God, asketh this wisedome, that thereby he might be fitted for his kingly calling, and enabled to performe the duties of gouernment; the which his wish was approued of God, and according to his desire this wisedome was granted vnto him. But being considered as it is in vs, it is neither abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely good or bad, but according to the vse, good to those that vse it well, and euill vnto those who abuse it vnto euill. Now in respect of the vse, ciuil policie and wisedom is good, lawfull and laudable, when it is vsed with these cautions: first, when it is ioyned with meeknes and humilitie. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when it is tempered and moderated with Christian sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie and sinceritie, so as wee may say with the Apostle, <hi>Our reioycing is this, the testimonie of our conscience, that in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 12.</note>
                  <hi>simplicitie and godly purenes, and not in fleshly wisedome, we haue
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10731:64"/> had our conuersation in the world.</hi> Thirdly, when it is ioyned with truth and fidelitie, iust and vpright dealing. Fourthly, when onely lawfull and good meanes be vsed for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and accomplishing of our designes, for that onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth the name of wisedome, when by the vse of honest and lawfull meanes a man can bring to passe things of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie. Fiftly, when as therein wee aime at good ends, as the aduancement of Gods glorie, the furtherance of his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the good of the Church and Common-wealth, and the benefit and welfare, either of our selues, or our neighbours. And lastly, when being indued with this wisedome wee doe not glorie in it, nor set our hearts vpon it, preferring it in our loue, before that wisedome which is diuine and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, nor trusting and relying vpon it more then vpon Gods promises, prouidence and assistance. Whereby it appeareth, that if wee will entertaine ciuill and worldly wisedome, wee must deliuer it from many corruptions to which vsually it is inthralled: and as one saith, if we be in loue with <hi>this captiue woman because she is beautifull to the sight, we must shaue off her</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hieronym. ad Pammachium, tom. 1.</note>
                  <hi>alluring haires, take away the deceitfull ornaments of her inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing words; cut off the dead nailes of rapine and greedinesse, and wash her cleane with that fullers soape and niter of the Prophet,</hi> that is, purge and reforme her according to the doctrine of the Prophets, and word of God. And if these cautions bee thus obserued, then is it lawfull to vse this ciuill policie, and to our doue like simplicitie, to adde the serpentine wisedom. As for example, we may in Christian policie make question of mens faire pretences, when wee haue no sound reason, whereupon we may ground our beliefe, and may make triall before we trust them, especially in matters of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, hauing for our president the example of our Sauiour Christ, who though many professed that they beleeued in him, when they saw his miracles, yet knowing their vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie,<note place="margin">Ioh. 2. 24.</note> he would not commit himselfe vnto them. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we may vse all good and lawfull policie, to preserue the peace of the Church, and to further the Gospell: and thus <hi>Paul</hi> by the aduice of the other Apostles associates himselfe with the foure Nazarites in their purifications and offrings,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:10731:65"/> as though himselfe had been one also, that hereby he might<note place="margin">Acts 21. 23. 26.</note> giue satisfaction to the Iewes, who were zealous in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall law, by submitting himselfe to the rites thereof. And thus it is lawfull to vse the like policie for the auoiding of persecution; as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> did, when in that diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<note place="margin">Acts 23. 6. Genes. 32.</note> assemblie hee professed himselfe a Pharisie. And <hi>Iacob,</hi> when as being in danger of his brother, he vsed all good po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie to abate, or at least auoid his furie. Finally, these cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons obserued, we may lawfully vse all good policies and stratagems in the time of warre, as we may see in the practise<note place="margin">Iosua 8. 5. Iud. 20. 29. 2. Sam. 5. 23.</note> of <hi>Iosua,</hi> of the Israelites against the Beniamites, and of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> guided and instructed herein by Gods owne word.</p>

Neither is it a signe of true wisdome to make a shew thereof, seeing there are not so many wise, as professors of wisdome: and (as one saith) <hi>If we were truly wise, we would not thinke so;</hi> much lesse boast of it, for to conceit a mans owne wisedome is the first degree to folly; and the next step is, to professe and vaunt of it: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he who is truly wise glorieth not in that he hath, but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his defects, groneth for that he wanteth.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, worldly policie is vnlawfull and wicked, when as it is seuered from Christian simplicitie and sinceritie; for these our Sauiour hath conioyned, willing vs to be as wise<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3.

For true wisdome promiseth, that <hi>her mouth shall speake the truth, and her lips abhorre wickednesse, that all the words of her mouth shall be found righteous, that there shall be no lewdnesse nor frowardnes in them; and that she will cause her fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to walke in the way of righteousnesse, and in the middest of the pathes of iudgement.</hi> So the sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> saith, that <hi>true wisdome is farre from pride and deceit, and men that lie cannot remember her, but men of truth shall haunt her, and shall prosper euen to the beholding of God.</hi> Againe, it is euill and vnlawfull, when as men vse wicked and vniust meanes for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing of their desires, as lying, faoing, swearing, for swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, treacherie and double dealing; or when as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound vnto themselues, in their policies, vngodly and sinfull ends, whereby either God is dishonored, their brethren en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damaged, or their owne consciences wounded, and saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hindered: for (as one saith) <hi>to be wise vnto euill, is not to</hi>

                  <hi>play the wise man, but the foole.</hi> Finally; this ciuill wisdome is euill to them who haue an ouerweening conceit of it, extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and magnifying it aboue it worth, and placing in it (with <hi>Aristotle</hi>) their chiefe happinesse; as also to those who in their loue so dote on it, that they preferre it before that wisdome which is diuine and spirituall, whereas it should be but an handmaid vnto it, giuing it precedence and place when both cannot stand together. To conclude, it is euill to those who put their trust in their owne wisdome and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:10731:66"/> either for prouision of those things they desire, or for their preseruation from dangers, more then in God himself, who is our onely preseruer and protector; contrarie to the perswasion of the Wise man, who exhorteth vs to <hi>trust in the</hi>

                  <hi>Lord with all our hearts, and not leane vnto our owne wisdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus haue I shewed, how and in what respects this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. Worldly wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is to be contemned, first because God esteemeth it not.</hi>
                  </note> wisdome and policie is to be accounted warrantable and good, and how it is to be esteemed euill and vnlawfull: in which respect we are not to set our hearts on it, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne and hate, shun and auoid it: which that we may doe, let these reasons moue vs: first, because this worldly and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall wisdome is not good, nor of any worth and excellencie, but euill, base and contemptible: and secondly, because it bringeth vnto vs no true good or profit, but hurt and disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. That there is in it no worth or excellencie, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, because God esteemeth it not: for whereas he reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his chiefe iewels, and gifts of value, onely for his owne seruants and children, he bestoweth this ciuill and morall wisdome, as a common gift both vpon the godly and the reprobate, as appeareth in the example of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> who though he were desperately wicked, as we may plainly see in that cursed counsell which he gaue to <hi>Absolon,</hi> yet had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from God such a large measure of this gift of ciuill wisdome, that he was not only thought meet to be a chiefe counseller to <hi>Dauid,</hi> but <hi>the counsell which he gaue in those</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Sam. 16. 23.</note>
                  <hi>daies, was esteemed as if one had asked counsaile at the oracle of God: so was all the counsell of Achitophel both with Dauid and with Absolon.</hi> And the like might be said of many others, which for breuitie I ouerpasse. Againe, that the Lord estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and regardeth not, these great Polititians who are wise in their owne conceits, <hi>Elihu</hi> plainly saith it, and Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling<note place="margin">Iob 37. 24.</note> with them as plainly proueth it; for being to gather vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himselfe a select multitude, whereof to make his Church, and seruants of his owne familie, whom he will sanctifie in this life, and saue, glorifie and crowne with eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the life to come; he passeth by these great Polititians, and vouchsafeth not to call many of these wise men after the<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 26.</note> flesh, as the Apostle affirmeth, but leauing them to enioy
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:10731:66"/> their glorie, of being counsellers to Princes and Potentates of the world, which they most desire and value, he maketh them none of his counsaile, but keeping all his secrets close<note place="margin">Matth. 11. 25.</note> from them, he reuealeth them to such as they esteeme babes and fooles. And therefore seeing the Lord so basely estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of worldly policie, let vs (making his infinite wisdome the rule according to which we are to conforme and square our iudgement) learne also to scorne and contemne it; and labour after that spirituall and diuine wisdome, which will make vs wise vnto God, and further our glorie and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting happinesse.</p>
               <p>But this may further our contempt of this worldly wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 5. That the diuell is the author of worldly wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
                  </note> if we consider that it is not onely not good, or of any worth, but also corrupt and exceeding euill. For first, if we will deriue the pedegree of it, we shall find that it is more ancient then noble, the diuell himselfe being the father and first founder of it: for the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> plainly telleth vs, that <hi>this worldly wisedome which descendeth not from aboue, is</hi>

                  <hi>earthly, sensuall and diuellish.</hi> Earthly, because it mindeth only earthly things, and maketh vs neuer to forecast how after we depart from the earth we may come to heauen: sensuall, not only because it beleeueth nothing, but that which is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the senses, or may be demonstrated by carnall reason, but because it also moueth men to pamper themselues in sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall delights, and voluptuous pleasures; as thinking that there is no other Paradise but the earthly Eden; and diuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, because it came from the diuell as the first author, and is continually taught by the same schoole-master; and will also bring them to the diuell who vse and practise it, vnlesse they preuent their damnation by vnfained repentance.</p>

                  </note> childe doth not degenerate from this wicked parent, if wee consider further of it, we shall finde that it exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth him in the vety countenance. For first, as the diuell with despitefull malice opposeth himselfe against the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie of God: so this worldly wisedome being his of spring, taketh the fathers part, and opposeth it selfe with like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice against the wisedome of God. For so the Apostle saith,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:10731:67"/>
                  <hi>that the wisedome of the flesh is emnitie with God.</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> the wisedome of God opposeth against the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the world, and so detesteth it, that he cannot abide that there should be any mixture thereof with his spirituall wisedome, in the worke of his ministerie, which he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the gathering of his Church, and for their edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the holy faith. So the Apostle saith, <hi>that Christ sent him to preach the Gospell, not with wisedome of words, lest the</hi>

                  <hi>which come to naught, but the wisedome of God, which none of the Princes of this world hath knowne,</hi> &amp;c. And by reason of this opposition, the one doth not allow and approue of the other, but interchangeably censure and condemne one the other of meere follie. So the wisedome of the world iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth of the wisedome of God; for the Apostle saith, that the preaching of the Gospell is to them that perish, and to the<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 18. 23.</note> wise Grecians, esteemed foolishnes: and therefore when Christs worldly kinred heard him in his sermons deliuer this spirituall wisedome from his Father, they went to lay hold on him, because they thought him out of his wits. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son<note place="margin">Mar. 3. 21.</note> hereof is, because worldly wisedome can rellish nothing, but that which is subiect to the senses, or may bee demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by carnall reason; to which rules Gods wisedome submitteth not it selfe, but oftentimes soareth an higher pitch, speaking and doing things which are besides, aboue, and contrary to naturall reason, that the infinite depth and power thereof may better appeare. To this purpose one saith, <hi>that there is another wisedome of the flesh, which being</hi>

And hereby they make faire weather, when they intend a storme shall follow, they carrie two faces vnder one hood, making shew of loue where they mortally hate, &amp; smile vpon those whom they desire to kill, like their predecessor <hi>Ioab,</hi> who stabbed

Yea so contrarie are simplicitie and puritie to worldly wisedome, that the Apostle also opposeth the one to the other, saying, that he <hi>had his conuersation in the world in simplicitie and godly purenes, and not in fleshly wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi>

In which trecheries they are so fleshed, that they acknowledge no friendship, nor regard the neerest kinred, but without respect of persons, tread all vnder foote, which stand in their way, and seeme to hinder their wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes. The which their treason and villanie being discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, doth not at all daunt them in their cursed courses, but one iniurie occasioneth▪ another, and when they haue no other reason of doing wrong, they will still doe it, because they haue done it; and according to their prouerbe, whom they haue once iniured, they will neuer forgiue, but adde one wrong vnto another; like cruell cowards, still kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping downe him whom they haue vniustly ouerthrowne, lost

This forsooth is that wisdome which is knowne of yong men by vse, and learned of children at deare rates: who so know this, they shew their pride in despising others, and those who are ignorant hereof, as vnderlings and timorous persons admire it in those that haue it; because this same doublenesse, being cloaked with iniquitie, is loued of them, whilest peruersitie of mind is called courtlinesse.

                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 21.</note>
                  <hi>God, it pleased God by the foolishnesse of preaching to saue them that beleeue.</hi> Whereby it appeareth, that worldly wisedome helpeth not to the knowledge of spirituall things; nor at all furthereth the saluation of our soules: but serueth onely worldlings (like the Ostrich wings) to this vse, to hasten their speed, and make them to outrun others vpon the earth, and in earthly things; but cannot helpe them to flie towards heauen, by the spirituall knowledge of God and our Sauiour Christ.</p>
               <p>The reason why worldlings by their worldly wisedome<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 14. The reason why worldly wisdom vnderstandeth not the things of God.</hi> Matth. 11. 25.</note> cannot vnderstand the things of God, is, because this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall knowledge is hid from them, as appeareth by that thanksgiuing of our Sauiour Christ: <hi>I giue thee thankes O fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Lord of heauen and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise, and men of vnderstanding, and hast reuealed them vnto babes.</hi> And this reason our Sauiour rendreth why hee spake to worldlings in parables, and to his Disciples plainly, <hi>Because to these it was giuen to know the secrets of the kingdome</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 13. 11.</note>
                  <hi>of heauen, but to them it was not giuen.</hi> And this hapneth vnto them by the iust iudgement of God, that they should thus be giuen ouer to their owne blindnesse: first in regard of their pride, which causeth them to withdraw themselues from God, and to shut their eyes against the light of his reuealed will, preferring farre before it, their owne wisedome and deepe policie, vpon which can nothing follow but palpable darknes; for as when the face of the Moone looketh directly vpon the Sunne, from whom she borroweth her brightnes,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:10731:71"/> she is full of light, but being auerted and turned from it, doth lose all, sauing only a shadow of light which is her owne: so when we set our face vpon the Sunne of righteousnes Iesus Christ, and depend vpon his instruction for our illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are full of the light of sauing knowledge; but when we turne our backs vpon him, we lose all our brightnes, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that light of nature and of carnall wisedome, which in comparison of this spirituall light of sauing knowledge, is no better then a shadow. Besides, when they are proud of this earthly trash, the Lord will not giue them the true trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; and because they glorie so much in a glittering coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they forget the giuer, the Lord will not vouchsafe to bestow vpon them his pure gold and richest iewels. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe they, being conceited of their owne wisedom, make any account of the wisedome of God, and knowledge of his will, nor vse any meanes appointed by God to attaine vnto it: yea their own carnall wisedome so puffeth them▪ vp with pride, that in comparison thereof, they skorne the wisedome of God, and of his Gospell, and esteeme it no better then<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 18.</note> meere foolishnes. And therefore no maruell if the Lord doe withhold his gifts from those that doe contemne them, and denie to giue this precious pearle of heauenly wisedome, and sauing knowledge, to these filthie swine, who would but tread it vnder their feete. To this purpose one saith, that <hi>those cannot behold the wisedome of God, who are wise in their</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 20.</note>
                  <hi>foolishnes?</hi> Not vnfitly therefore are fooles in our accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med speech called naturals, seeing the wisest man who is but meerely naturall is a very foole, both because hee is vtterly destitute of spirituall and sauing wisedome, and also because the Lord turneth that carnall wisedome he hath into sottish foolishnes. So when <hi>Saul,</hi> leauing the Lord, began to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by his owne wisedome, the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> telleth him, that hee had done foolishly, in not keeping the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement<note place="margin">1.

And into what extreame follie did the wise counsell of <hi>Achitophel</hi> bring him, causing him to hang himselfe, for feare of a worse turne; and to auoide the Kings deserued displeasure, by leaping into hell? The reason here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is apparant, for though mans wisedome be neuer so great, yet it is not infinite; hee cannot foresee future contingents, much lesse dispose them, and therefore whilest he auoideth one danger which hee foresaw, he is ouertaken by another which was without the compasse of his prouidence; and hauing setled his counsels vpon the ground of many proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities or certainties, one whereof seemeth to cohere with another, some thing which either was not, or could not bee foreseene, happening, disordreth and confoundeth all the rest, and so bringeth all his policies to nothing; like a chaine which falleth asunder when but one linke thereof is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Who therefore would esteeme of this worldly wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, seeing it doth not with any certaintie procure that good, for which it is onely good, nor attaineth vnto often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

It bringeth not with it so much as worldly ioy and pleasure, but rather vexation of spirit, and much heauinesse. And as the Wise man saith, who had most experience of it; <hi>In the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of wisdome is much griefe, and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow:</hi> for he is still iealous of his state, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies readie to cast doubts: he hath more skill in foreseeing euils, then in preuenting them; and long before they come he doth anticipate them with his feare and care; grieuing long before the cause of griefe approcheth, and making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe presently miserable, because hee expecteth miserie in time to come; yea and oftentimes he thus tormenteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with a shadow, and through false feare indureth true sorrow, the euill which he feared and expected neuer happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto him: but if the euill which he feareth commeth, then to what end serueth this worldly wisdome, but to make it giue a deeper wound with ouer vehement apprehension? to gather arguments to amplifie his griefe, and with the waight of opinion, to make his burthen more intollerable? whereas those whose wit hath a shorter reach; lay not hold of miseries before they touch them, nor complaine of more then they sensibly feele; and oftentimes shadowes of ill grounded hopes, bring vnto them for the present, substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all comfort.<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 20.

And though these wise worldlings could with their subtile policies escape this destruction in this life, yet it will surely ouertake them in the life to come, and cast them head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the pit of perdition: for as the Apostle saith, <hi>the wisdome of the flesh causeth death:</hi> that is, not onely the first<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 6.</note> death, whereby they die vnto righteousnes and all goodnes, but also the second death, whereby dying they shall neuer die, but liue to die that dying life, or liuing death, in those intollerable and euerlasting torments of hell fire.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore this worldly and carnall wisedome is so<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 21. That we are to cōtemne world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wisdome, and to labour after that which is diuine and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</hi>
                  </note> euill and wicked in it selfe; and the cause of so many euils vnto vs; let vs not enuie worldlings this their happinesse wherein they so much boast and glorie; but learne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:10731:74"/> and hate it, as being an enemie to God and our owne saluation. For what will it aduantage vs to be admired for it in the world, and to be despised in the sight of God? to haue it commend vs, and God and our owne consciences to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne vs? to be aduanced by it to the counsel of Princes, and to haue Gods counsailes and the mysteries of our saluation hid and concealed from vs? Finally, what will it auaile vs, if by it we should be exalted to the greatest offices of state, and highest places in the kingdome, if we be excluded thereby from hauing so much as the lowest place in the kingdome of heauen? What will it profit vs to gaine with our policies worldly vanities, and those temporarie trifles of honors, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and earthly pleasures, of which we haue not one dayes assurance, and to lose thereby those eternall ioyes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable pleasures, which are at Gods right hand for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more? Leauing therefore this carnall wisedome, to carnall worldlings; let vs labour to be wise vnto God, and seeke those things in the first place which tend to his glorie, and the saluation of our owne soules: and let vs vse all good meanes to furnish our hearts and minds with all sanctifying and sauing graces, and especially with that spirituall wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whereby we vnderstand his will reuealed in his word, and endeauour to conforme our selues vnto it in all holy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, both in our hearts and affections, and in our liues and conuersations; and so will the Lord approue, loue and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour vs in this life, and crowne vs with euerlasting ioy and happinesse in the life to come.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:10731:75"/> corruption, and so hurtfull and pernicious to those who set their hearts on them, that they iustly deserue to be hated and reiected. Now it followeth, that according to my order pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, I adde some thing of the gifts and ornaments of the mind, namely, the gifts of humane learning, and of sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and knowledge, which the world abuseth as occasions and grounds of dangerous tentations. And first I will speake briefly of humane learning; consisting principally in the knowledge, memorie and skilfull vse of arts and languages; the which is in it owne nature good, as being an excellent gift of God, whereby the mind of man is adorned, and his naturall gifts and faculties much improued, polished and perfected; so as it is a question disputable, whether nature, or this art and learning are of greater vse and efficacie, for the directing and perfecting of such humane affaires, as are of greatest excellencie. By it the harshnes and roughnesse of nature is mollified and mitigated, barbarisme banished, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilitie preserued and increased, all things which tend to the well-being and bettering of humane societie perfected, and in a word, hereby the rough fallow grounds of our hearts are as it were ploughed vp, and fitted and prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the seeds of diuine knowledge. In it owne nature ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, humane learning is not only good but very excellent, and is not contemned and hated by any, but those who are rude and ignorant, yea it ought in this sense to be esteemed and sought after as a pearle of price, which is much to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all the treasures and honors of the world; as being a singular ornament of the mind, which euen in the iudgement of Gods Spirit maketh his faithfull seruants more praise-worthie; for thus the holy Ghost commendeth <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> for his excellent learning, saying, that he <hi>was learned in all</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 7. 22.</note>
                  <hi>the wisedome of the Aegyptians,</hi> among whom learning in those daies chiefely flourished; and <hi>Apollos,</hi> whom he also<note place="margin">Acts 18. 24.</note> praiseth for his eloquence and knowledge.</p>
               <p>But if we consider of this learning as it is in vs, then is it to<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. That worldly learning becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth euill vnto vs, when it is abused.</hi>
                  </note> be esteemed among things indifferent, the which according as they are vsed by the partie that hath them, are either good when they are well vsed, or euill when they are abused, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:10731:75"/> the nature of them infected and poysoned through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of our corrupt nature. And thus learning is good, when it is well vsed for those good purposes aboue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to which in it owne nature it inclineth, and furthereth those good ends for which God hath ordained it; and euill, when as it is abused through our corruption; as namely, when as we wax so proud of this gift of God, that we forget the giuer, or insult ouer our brethren who are not qualified with it; for as learning is the ornament of the minde, so hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie is the ornament of learning. Secondly, when as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing idle and fruitlesse it helpeth not forward those ends for which it was giuen vs, neither bettering the minde, nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the affections, nor reforming the life and manners, nor increasing ciuilitie, nor yet fitting and preparing vs for true religion; but contenting our selues with an idle theorie and speculation, we vse our knowledge only to know, as the Athenians were said to vse their money, only to tell it; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be now and then, when wee affect the praise of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in discoursing with others. Thirdly, when as wee set our hearts wholly vpon it, and spend all our time in attaining vnto it, and hauing obtained it, doe finally rest in it; as though it were the cause of our comming into the world, and the very end of our liues, to get humane learning; whereas it ought to be the way, and not our marke and chief scope, and as an handmaide to trimme and adorne vs, and so to vsher vs into the presence of vertue and true godlinesse, and not to bee esteemed▪ and adored as our chiefe Ladie and soueraigne Princesse. For this were to content our selues to liue in the porch, and neglect the beautifull lodging which it leadeth vnto; and like <hi>Penelope</hi> her suiters, to leaue the Mistrisse, and make loue to the handmaid. Fourthly, when as wee haue an insatiable desire in hoarding vp these rich trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, being neuer satisfied, but euer curiously prying into the very hidden bowels of natures secrets: for the Apostle telleth vs, there is a measure of our vnderstanding, as well<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 3.</note> as of our stature, aboue which when it is racked, it bringeth as much torment to the minde, as the other to the body; and that there is a sobrietie in our soules, which contenteth it
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:10731:76"/> selfe with a competent portion of this spiritual food of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and knowledge; the which being exceeded, causeth a surfet, which casteth the minde into diuers and dangerous diseases which are hardly cured. And another demandeth, if he be to be reproued, which gathereth needlesse superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and in his house setteth out to the shew an outward pompe of precious things, and he to be excused which is too much occupied, in gathering superfluous abundance of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; humane knowledge? Yea (saith he) to desire to know more then enough, is to be reprehended, as being a kind of<note place="margin">

Lastly, this learning is abused when we ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value and esteeme it, as when wee place therein our chiefe happinesse, or preferre it before the knowledge of God and his true religion, or the rest of his sanctifying and sauing graces, aduancing the handmaides aboue their mistrisse, and esteeming the confused languages of Babel, aboue that excellent language of the spirituall Canaan.</p>
               <p>In which respects when learning is abused, it degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. That worldly learning is to be contemned, first because it doth not profit vs.</hi>
                  </note> from his owne nature, and becommeth vnto vs euill, worldly and wicked, and is therefore of all Gods seruants to be contemned and despised, loathed and abhorred. Now that wee may contemne this worldly and wicked learning, which is so much admired among carnall men who haue attained vnto it, let vs consider, first, that it bringeth with it no true profit; and then, that it is the cause of much hurt. That this learning of carnall worldlings profiteth them not, it may appeare by induction of particulars. For what doth it auaile them to be good Logicians, when as they are neither skilfull in finding out what the good and perfect will of God is, nor able to iudge betweene that which is good and euill, nor to confute the subtill sophistrie and dangerous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralogismes of our spirituall enemie the diuell, whereby out of false premises he frameth against their soules most dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable conclusions? What doth it profit them to bee good Rhetoricians in perswading of others vnto what they list, by setting a faire glosse vpon a false cause, if they haue not sound eloquence enough, to perswade and assure themselues of their owne saluation? What doth it helpe them to bee
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:10731:76"/> good Grammarians, and to haue the knowledge of all tongues and languages, if there be no congruitie betweene<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 1.</note> Gods law, and their life and manners, and hauing their heads full fraught with this learned skill, their hearts bee emptie of loue and charitie? What benefit haue they by their exquisite skill in Arithmetike, whereby they are able to number numbers numberlesse, if they want skill to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their daies, that they may appli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> their hearts to true wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? What though like good Geometricians they could measure all the parts of the earth, and take the height, and demonstrate the bignes of all the starres of heauen; if they haue no measure in their passions, appetites, and earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires? What though like cunning Astronomers and Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logians, they knew the number of the starres, with all their motions, the constellations, aspects, and influences of these celestiall bodies, and could neerely gesse at future contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, and things to come; if their hearts and affections re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine fastned to the earth, when their eies are lift vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, so as they can neuer raise them on high with any spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and holy meditation? What though like cunning Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians, they be skilfull in all the moods, chords, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; if they cannot accord the iarring discords of their owne passions, nor make that sweete harmonie in Gods hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, by causing their heart, tongue and hand to accord and agree together, in a holy and vpright profession and practise of godlinesse and righteousnesse? What will it helpe skilfull Philosophers, though they were able to vnbowell the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of nature, to know the causes and yeeld the reason of all things, which curiositie her selfe could inquire; if they be ignorant of the great Creator, and of themselues, neither knowing the corruption of their nature, nor the meanes how to bee freed from it? What will it profit them if like skilfull Historians, they can relate what hath been done in all countries, in all ages, if they be not well acquainted with the historie of the Bible, and the Gospell of Iesus Christ▪ nor know what he hath done for their saluation? What though like cunning Lawyers they be learned in the lawes of men, if they bee ignorant in the law of God, and lawlesse and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencious
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:10731:77"/> in their liues and conuersations? What will it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile them if being skilfull Physitians, they can gesse at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens diseases by feeling of their pulses and seeing their vrines, and can applie fit remedies for the curing of their bodies; if they cannot iudge of the distempered passions of their owne hearts, nor know by what meanes their soules sick in sin, may be cured and recouered? And to conclude, what benefit should wee reape, though being learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, wee are able to dispute of the deepe mysteries of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; if we doe not make a holy vse of this knowledge, for the sanctifying of our hearts, and the reforming of our liues and conuersations?</p>
               <p>Secondly, the vnprofitablenes of worldly learning hereby<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. That worldly learning is vaine, and of no excellencie.</hi>
                  </note> is manifest, in that it is vaine and of no excellencie; for first it is so farre from conferring of true wisedome, consisting in the knowledge and feare of God, that it is oftentimes disioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from that wisedome which is morall and ciuill, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the prouerbe which is grounded vpon common experience, The learnedest Clerks are not alwaies the wisest men; they being so wedded to their book-learning and the theorie of knowledge in speculation only, that they neglect that practicall knowledge which is chiefly perfected by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation and experience. Now, as one saith, <hi>A man learned and vnwise, is like an asse decked with costly ornaments,</hi> which<note place="margin">Literatus stul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus est phalera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus asinus.</note> make him to bee more looked on, but not more esteemed. Secondly, the vanitie of worldly learning may appeare, in that it hath in it no selfe excellencie to giue contentment to him y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> hath it by it own worth, vnlesse that ostentation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be made vnto others, that so they may admire and praise it. To which purpose the Satyrist saith, that <hi>it nought auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to know, vnlesse another knoweth that thou hast this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>but this is that which is thought worth esteeme, to be poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at with the finger, &amp; to be noted for excellencie aboue others.</hi> Lastly, worldly learning without true godlinesse is vaine, because it doth not fill and satisfie him that hath it; for hee that hath spent most paines in studie, and hath attained to the greatest measure of learning and knowledge, is no more contented or satisfied, then he was when he had learned but
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:10731:77"/> the first rudiments: because the more he knoweth, the more<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hoc vnum scie. me nihil scire.</hi> Socrates.</note> he seeth his want of knowledge; and the highest degree of learning in this state of imperfection, cōsisteth in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a mans owne ignorance. And therefore the Wise man saith, that <hi>he that increaseth knowledge increaseth griefe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ac sane qui ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit scientiam addit dolorem, vt qui non plus v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>because he doth not receiue so much pleasure by that which hee hath found out, as sorrow for that vnto which he is not able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; like vnto those who being yet a thirst, are pulled frō the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or that cannot hold in their hands that which they think they haue; or like vnto those who are inlightened with the brightnes of the lightning; which light presently leauing them, they remaine in more grosse darknesse then before.</hi> And this vanitie of humane learning is the cause why the Saints of God haue so contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it; for hauing attained to the knowledge of God and his will, of our Sauiour Christ, and the worke of saluation wrought by him, they haue in comparison of this excellent knowledge, accounted the other base and of no worth. An example whereof we haue in <hi>Paul,</hi> who being indued with a great measure of this humane learning, contemneth it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing that <hi>he cared not to know any thing, saue Iesus Christ</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 2.</note>
                  <hi>and him crucified.</hi> As also in the Ephesians, who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to the faith, and indued with some measure of sauing knowledge, <hi>brought their bookes, out of which they had learned</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 19. 19.</note>
                  <hi>their curious arts, and burned them before all men, the price whereof amounted to fiftie thousand pieces of siluer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, the vnprofitablenesse of worldly learning hereby<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 5. Worldly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning helpeth vs not to the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Gods spiritual graces.</hi>
                  </note> appeareth, in that it furthereth not our saluation, nor bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs neerer vnto God, neither in this life by grace, nor by glorie in the life to come: for it helpeth not at all to inrich vs with any of Gods sanctifying and sauing graces, but excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all others in this kind of learning, we may be as misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie poore in those inestimable treasures as the most simple idiots. And this the examples of former times &amp; of our owne daies doe plainly manifest: for who more learned then the Aegyptians, and who more grosse idolaters? Who more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then <hi>Pharaohs</hi> inchanters, and astrologians, and who more diuellish sorcerers? who more learned then the Scribes and Pharisies, and who more gracelesse and wicked? Finally,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:10731:78"/> who more learned then those great Clerkes, and profound Doctors, which vphold (vpon the strength of their shoulders) the declining Monarchie of the Babylonish Antichrist, and yet who more licentious in their liues? who more malitious opposers against the kingdome and truth of Iesus Christ? who more cruell persecuters of the Saints of God? But let vs descend to more particulars, this worldly learning doth not at all inlighten our minds with sauing knowledge, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richeth our vnderstanding with spirituall wisdome; as may also appeare by the former examples; for there was neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in their times excelled those before named in this lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and neuer any more blindly ignorant, euen in the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and first principles of true religion. In which respect, they may fitly be compared to Battes and Owles, which see very acutely in the darke, but are dim-sighted and pur-blind when the Sunne shineth: so these remaining in natural dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, see very cleerely the vnprofitable and nice quiddities of vaine Philosophie, but when the light of the Gospel cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shineth, they are not thereby inlightned, for their Owle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like eyes cannot endure this brightnes, neither doth it helpe their sight, but makes them more pur-blind then before. So also it doth not profit vs for the attaining of faith, yea rather it confirmeth and encreaseth naturall infidelitie; for whereas <hi>faith is of things not seene,</hi> and not grounded on sense, but rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">Hebr. 11. 1.</note> vpon Gods word and promises, as being truth it selfe which cannot deceiue, these learned worldlings credit no more then they see, nor beleeue any thing which may not be demonstrated by the rules of their learning. And for this we haue the Pharisies testimonie against themselues, where speaking to their seruants, who were astonished with Christs doctrine, they demand, if <hi>any of the Rulers and Pharisies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 7. 48.</note>

                     </gap>aw are cursed.</hi> And so we shall find that the doctrine of faith taught by the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> was neuer more vnprofitable<note place="margin">Act. 17. 18. 32.</note> and vnfruitfull, then among the Athenians, neuer more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, nor more derided, nor euer fewer in any place by so much preaching conuerted to the faith, then among these learned Philosophers. The like might be said of all other san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:10731:78"/> graces: for who are more dotingly fond of worldly vanities, of riches, pleasures and preferments, and shew lesse loue to God in their holy obedience, thē the learned world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings? who trust more in the arme of flesh and inferiour meanes when they haue them, or are more desperately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and discomfited when these meanes faile them? Who shew lesse hope then they, when they are in any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or vpon their sicke beds? who lesse feare of God in all their proceedings? or lesse humilitie in their cariage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation? In a word, who are more barren and fruitlesse in good workes, in the workes of iustice, charitie and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion towards their brethren?</p>
               <p>And as it is no furtherance in attaining vnto Gods graces<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. Worldly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning helpeth not to the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</hi>

In the next place wee are to speake of the tentations which arise from worldly science and knowledge; the which are either the skill and knowledge of ciuill and mechanicall Arts and Sciences, or of the holy Scriptures, and of the points of Christian religion; both which are in themselues good, as being the common gifts of Gods spirit, and his profitable talents, which being well vsed, do much redound to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God, the author of them, and to the good of the Church and Common-wealth, for whose sake principallie these gifts of God were conferred and bestowed. And this appeareth in the example of <hi>Aholiab</hi> and <hi>Bezaliel,</hi> of whom it is said, that <hi>the Lord called them by name, and filled them</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 31. 2. 3. 4. 5. and 36. 2. 3.</note>
                  <hi>with his spirit, in wisedome and vnderstanding, and in knowledge and in all workmanship, to finde out curious workes, to worke in gold, and in siluer, and in brasse; also in the art to set stones, and to carue in timber, and to worke all manner of workmanship for the seruice of the Sanctuarie.</hi> And therefore these Arts and Sciences are not simply to be contemned, yea rather they are to be much valued and esteemed, as being Gods good gifts,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:10731:80"/> which hee hath bestowed vpon some speciall men, for his owne glorie, and the common good of humane societies; but only as they are abused by carnall worldlings excelling in them.</p>
               <p>And thus they abuse them, first, when in sight of their<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. Hovv vvorldly sciences are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused.</hi>
                  </note> owne excellencie they are puffed vp in pride, and contemne others, especially of their owne facultie, who haue not attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto their skill. Secondly, when they set their hearts vpon them, preferring and esteeming them before Gods spirituall graces and sanctifying gifts, and neglecting them together with the meanes whereby they may attaine vnto them, whilest they set and imploy all their desires and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours about these earthly sciences. And lastly, when as they seuer these common gifts of the Spirit, from Gods sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and sauing graces, being content to remaine vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of the true feare of God, knowledge, faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and the rest; as though they needed them not, being qualified aboue others with this worldly skill.</p>
               <p>But in these respects, these Sciences and cunning skill,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. That vvorldly sciences are to be contemned.</hi>
                  </note> though good in themselues, are to bee contemned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised: for if it be a great sinne to be proud of learning and the knowledge of ingenuous and liberall Arts, yea of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vertues and ciuill wisedome; and if they are to bee all contemned and despised, when they come in comparison of Gods holy and heauenly graces; then how much more is it a grieuous sinne to wax proud of these inferiour Sciences; or in respect of such contemptible qualities, to set light by, and contemne those vnualuable excellencies and heauenly treasures? Which sinne that all may auoid, and may learne to despise these Sciences as base trifles, when they come in comparison with the sauing knowledge of Gods truth, and our assurance of his spirituall treasures and eternal happines; let them consider that these Sciences are but common gifts bestowed both vpon the elect and reprobate, and vpon Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans as well as Christians, and therefore notwithstanding them, if they want Gods spirituall and sanctifying graces, they are still in the state of death &amp; condemnation; let them know that God hath giuen them these talents not that they
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:10731:80"/> should be puffed vp in pride, or neglecting his more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gifts, they should set their hearts on them, but that they should vse them to the glorie of him who bestowed them, and the good of the Church and Common-wealth; and therefore if they abuse them to contrary ends, the Lord will take away from them his gifts; or if hee suffer them to haue the vse of them, it shall be to bring vpon them a more heauy iudgement, and to increase their condemnation at the day of his generall assises, for their great abuse of his rich talents. Finally, let them remember that these worldly Sciences serue but to procure vnto them some temporarie profit or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement, which is but of small worth, and of momentanie continuance; and therefore they shall shew extreame follie if they more highly esteeme, and take more care, and spend more labour, in compassing these transitorie trifles, then in attaining vnto the vnualuable riches of Gods grace, and that eternall waight of glorie, and vnspeakeable happinesse in his kingdome.</p>

The other kinde of science, which I propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to speake of, is the knowledge of God, and of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his true religion, which in his word he hath reuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto vs. The which in it selfe is an excellent gift and grace of Gods spirit, and farre to be preferred before world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sciences, humane learning, yea aboue all meerely morall and ciuill vertues; as being that spirituall light which gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs in the paths of righteousnesse, that leade vs to Gods kingdome, and the very ground and foundation of all san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:10731:81"/> and sauing graces; for we cannot loue God, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, hope, and trust in him, vnlesse wee know him; nor yeeld any obedience vnto him, vnlesse wee bee acquainted with his word, wherein hee hath reuealed his will vnto vs. But yet this excellent gift of God is liable to the abuse of worldlings; (or if not that speciall grace of sauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which is alwaies accompanied with all other spirituall gifts, yet at least the counterfeit of this pure gold, which is so cunningly stamped and coyned, that it cannot possibly be discerned from the other, vnlesse it be brought to the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of true obedience) and so is made the ground of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers dangerous tentations: as namely, when men can no longer be led hoodwinckt with ignorance, in the broad way that leadeth to destruction, but plainly discerne that the knowledge of God and his will is most necessarie to their saluation, then the diuell and the world giue them libertie to take what paines they will in attaining vnto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods true religion, yea and oftentimes egge them on, when as they haue found out some necessarie know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, curiously to prie into Gods hidden secrets, and to search out that knowledge which is superfluous and vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, to the end that in the meane time they may neglect the knowledge of things which are of better vse. And when they haue proceeded thus farre, then they labour to make them proud of this knowledge, and to take all their delight in this speculatiue studie and contemplation, and in setting it foorth to the praise of men, in all their discourses; but withall they moue them to rest in this bare knowledge, as being sufficient to gaine for them the glorie of the world, and of heauen too; seuering it in the meane time, from all sanctifying and sauing graces, and from the fruitfull practise of that they know, in holy obedience to Gods will.</p>
               <p>Which tentations that we may ouercome, let vs consider,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. That our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is maimed and imperfect.</hi>
                  </note> that this idle knowledge (which swimmeth in the braine, and sanctifieth not the heart; but being wholly taken vp, and exercised in speculation and discourse, is seuered from the true loue of God and our neighbour, and from all san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying and sauing graces, as also from the practise and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:10731:81"/> vse of that we know in true obedience) is not at all to be esteemed of vs, but to be vtterly despised and contemned: first, because it is in it selfe of no worth or excellencie: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because to vs it is vnprofitable: thirdly, because it is hurtfull and pernicious. For the first, this idle knowledge which is in worldlings, is of no worth or excellencie, because it is imperfect and but a dimme shadow, in comparison of the cleare light; for that we know is nothing in comparison of that we know not; neither do we see these few things with the cleare eye of a distinct vnderstanding, but (as the Apostle<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>who desire to know, that they may be knowne; and this is foolish vanitie.</hi> Idle knowledge therefore is to be contemned as a thing vaine and of no value; yea so worthlesse it is, that the least will to good, and weakest desire to please God, is much to be preferred before it. And though it were supposed, that there were in this knowledge some worth and excellencie; yet the smallest sparke of true charitie and pietie were much to bee preferred before it: seeing long after this light of worldly knowledge is vanished, the heate of true loue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth euen for euer: for so the Apostle saith, that <hi>loue doth neuer fall away; though that prophecyings b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ignorance, if it be not wilfull (though it doth not take sin away, yet) it much lesseneth it, knowledge contrariwise doth much aggrauate it, making it to bee contemptuous, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious; against the conscience, and presumptuous, as being committed wittingly and willingly, and with an high hand against God, neglecting and despising his wil and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements reuealed vnto vs. And this appeareth by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours censure of the Scribes and Pharisies; <hi>If</hi> (saith hee) <hi>yee</hi>

Finally, he sinneth against himselfe, in making his condemnation more iust, and his fault more vnexcusable; for if the sinnes of the Gentiles<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note> became vnexcusable, because they were committed against the light of nature; then how much more are their sinnes without excuse, who haue much more perfect knowledge of Gods will, as it is reuealed in the holy Scriptures?</p>
               <p>And thus doth this vain &amp; idle knowledge hurt those that<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 8. Vnfruitfull knowledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth our reckoning at the day of iudgement.</hi>

                  </note> so it is in it selfe euill, as springing from the roote of sinne, and bringing foorth abundance of these cursed fruits. The roote from which it springeth, is sometimes pride, which moueth them, when they cannot match others in naturall beautie, to vse these artificiall helps, that thereby they may excell them in that which is counterfait. And sometime it springeth from lust, and the inward vncleannesse of the hart, which moueth them to vse these inueigling arts, that by see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming more beautifull then they are, they may ensnare the affections of those who looke vpon them. And as it is bred of these cursed parents, so it self is exceeding fruitful in brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging foorth the impious off-spring of manifold sinnes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted both against God, their neighbour and themselues. Against God they offend; by presuming to adulterate his worke, and by taking vpon them to amend that, which, (as they suppose) he hath made amisse; for they secretly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the workman, when they are displeased with his work, and seeme to taske him for want of wisdome and cunning, when they take vpon them to correct and make better that which he hath left vnperfected. To this purpose is that of<note place="margin">Cyprian: tract. 2. de habit. virg. pag. 109.</note>

Now what is this but vnnaturally to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie themselues, and to thrust (as it were) another into their owne place? what is it but to make themselues counterfeit idols, that vnto them lust may offer the sacrifices of vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? what is it, but to expose themselues to the scorne and laughter of those, who hauing seene their glorious beautie
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:10731:96"/> which they counterfeited, shall afterwards happen to see them in their owne complexion and naturall foulenesse; like a Player, who hauing acted a kingly part, and put off all his gorgeous ornaments, doth now appeare in his owne person and attire; sauing that herein it is much more absurd, in that they professe this disguising, and these dissemble it, desiring that it should be taken in good earnest, which the other doe in iest to make sport.</p>

And yet this is but the least part of their losse: for as they blemish their skinne, so they blot and disgrace their names, whilest following the practise of harlots, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruedly gaine for all their labour, their reputation; and to bee ranged and esteemed in their fellowship, whose maners they imitate.

And how farre are they from this Christian humilitie, who rather then they will not shew their pride, vaunt themselues of a counterfeit beautie, and for want of better matter, grow high in their owne conceit, because they haue this false shadow of true beautie, which indeed is it selfe but a shadow, in respect of any substantiall good?

Neither can it be imagined that hereby they can wind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into their husbands loue, or preserue him from vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lusts; for if neither the feare of God, nor the terrour of his iudgements, death, hell, and condemnation, nor yet the punishment inflicted by humane lawes, and the danger of falling hereby into innumerable euils, will deliuer him from following these courses; nor finally the loue of God and his sweete promises will allure them to the performance of his dutie; then how can it be imagined, that hee should be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with a painted vizard to embrace this coniugall loue, or be preserued from strange lusts with a false and counterfeit beautie? Yea contrariwise, let them rest assured that they make themselues hereby loathsome to their husbands, when as these artificiall supplies put them in minde of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall defects, and this counterfeit beautie, of that reall defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie which it hideth; like a rotten post which is painted, and gilded ouer to make a shew. And therefore (as one saith) they take a foolish course in seeking to approue themselues<note place="margin">Ambros. de Virgin. lib.</note> to their husbands iudgement, by disapprouing them in their owne; and to thinke to please others, when as being helped with selfe loue they cannot please themselues; for if they thought nothing wanting, they would not seeke by such meanes to make a supplie; if they did not thinke themselues deformed, they would neuer seeke grace from a false beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. If then thou wouldest haue thy husband esteeme thee, obserue rather a sober grauity, then affect a counterfeit beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;

Whereas if thou inurest him to loue in thee vertue, good qualities, modestie and sobrietie, he wil not easily be insnared by the adultresse, seeing she hath no such baites to allure his loue. Finally, doe not teach him to be willingly deceiued, with wanton laughter, and with a nice and affected gate; for so shalt thou but minister vnto him weapons, the point whereof may be turned against thy selfe; but rather seeke that he may take delight in chastitie, modestie, and sobrietie, and so shall hee haue armour of proofe to defend and preserue him from the incounters of an harlot.</p>

It is of no great worth, seeing the Lord himselfe doth little esteeme it: for as <hi>Elihu</hi> saith,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:10731:99"/>
                  <hi>he regardeth not them that excell in strength:</hi> and as the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist<note place="margin">Iob 36. 19.

How vaine therefore are those who are proud of such base vanities? wherein many wicked men match them, and many beasts doe farre excell them; how little good haue they in them, when they are faine to glorie in that, in which when they haue attained vnto the greatest measure which possibilitie incourageth them to desire, yet they come farre short of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants among men, and of the horse, bull, lion, and many other among the brutish creatures?

But say that sicknesse spareth vs, yet as old age approcheth, strength decreaseth, after which death hasteneth, which doth wholly abolish it, making the strongest giant &amp; the weakest wretch both alike. Consider further, that this huge strength of the body, is commonly ioyned with great weaknes of the mind; and where there is the greatest bone, there vsually is the least wisedome and vnderstanding. In which respect <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocles</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> compared the Eretrienses, a people more strong then wise, to the Swordfish, which hath a weapon but wants a heart. Neither doth it helpe to furnish the minde with any vertues, or maketh it more readie to any vertuous actions; but as those trees which are most great and strong, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly most vnfruitfull; so oftentimes those who excell in strength, are most barren in bearing the fruites of vertue, and least forward in such actions as sauour of goodnesse. Nor doth this bodily strength assist the soule in moderating of our affections, and in ouer-ruling of our passions; it doth not helpe to asswage anger, to bridle lust, or to stoppe our course, when wee runne to take reuenge; yea contrariwise being abused by our corruptions, it pricketh forward our rage with the spurres of armed furie; it maketh men more able slaues to their owne filthinesse, and in stead of stopping vs in reuengefull courses, it rather hasteth vs forward with headlong swiftnes, and putteth a sword of violence into our hands, whereby wee may not only requite old iniuries, but also reuenge apparances of wrongs with extreame crueltie. Yea it not only encourageth those that haue confidence in their owne strength, without reason or conscience, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse and tyrannically to tread vnder foote those whom they find themselues able to ouermatch; but so puffeth them vp in pride in regard of their owne abilities, that they are readie with desperate furie to make warre against heauen, and hauing gotten the victorie ouer men, to set vpon and encounter God himselfe. As appeareth in the example of that mightie <hi>Nimrod</hi> and his associates; and in <hi>Goliah,</hi> who<note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> not onely insulted ouer all <hi>Sauls</hi> armie in confidence of his

In which respect one saith, that <hi>this which wee vsually</hi>

                  <hi>call health of the bodie, is in truth sicknesse; seeing ease it selfe is sufficient to bring it into a consumption, and labor also doth cause it to faile: being spent with fasting, it is refreshed with meat, that it may continue, and being tired and wasted with ouermuch ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, it is relieued with abstinence, that it may grow stronger: the bodie is washed with water, that it may not be ouer drie, and then wiped with clothes, that it may not be too much moistned and soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; it is refreshed with labour, that it may not grow sluggish with case; and cherished with rest, that it may not sinke vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of labour; it is wearied with watching, and repaired with sleepe, and being oppressed with too much sleepe, this sluggishnesse is shaken off with watchfulnesse, lest it should be spent and wearied more with rest then with it labour. It is couered with clothes, that it may not feele the iniuries of the weather, and fainting with
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:10731:101"/> ouermuch heate, it is refreshed with the fanning of the coole aire. And hauing found troubles and griefes in that wherein it thought to haue auoided them, being sore wounded (as I may say) it lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth, and waxeth weaker with the very medicine, that should haue cured it. Though therefore feauers be absent, and griefes of bodie cease, euen our very health is no better then a sicknes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which necessitie of cure is neuer wanting: for looke how many helpes and comforts we seeke out for the vse of life, euen so many medicines doe we find to free vs from diseases; and oftentimes the salue it selfe turneth to a wound; because vsing an excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie a little too long, we are much impaired by that, which wee prouided for our cure.</hi> To the same purpose another saith, <hi>that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">August. in Psal. 37. enatrat. tom. 8.</note>
                  <hi>that which is called the health of this life, to them that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it aright, and do compare it with that which we shal inioy in our eternall rest, it is not esteemed worthie the name of health. For if we doe not eate, hunger vexeth vs, and what is this hunger, but a naturall disease? because nature it selfe by Gods iust venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is made vnto vs a punishment; and that which to the first man was punishment, is vnto vs turned into nature, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it is most imperfect, our whole life being like<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. That bodily health is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and full of infirmities.</hi>
                  </note> a continuall ague, which, euery second or third day, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeth health with sicknesse; neither is there any so strong and healthie, that hath not some griefes and infirmities which often vex him; although the pleasures and businesses of the world giue him not leasure to take great notice of them; and the youth and strength of his bodie doth enable him to beare his burden with more ease and cheerefulnesse. Or though it should be granted, that a man were quite free from all these bodily infirmities; yet if he hath many diseases in his soule, hee cannot bee said to haue any perfection of health, when as his best part is thus affected: for as it were ridiculous, if a man should glorie in his health, because hee is sound in his outward lims, when in the mean time he hath the megrim in his head, the consumption in his lungs, and incurable diseases about his heart, and other chiefe and vital parts; so is it no lesse absurd to be proud of our bodily health, when as our soules which are the chiefe part of man, and the life of all the rest, are desperately sicke in the diseases of sin.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:10731:102"/> For what is this, but to haue a faire skinne, and sicke hart, a beautifull outside, full and faire, and within, a desperate dropsie, or vnrecouerable pleurisie? like vnto an apple, which is faire to the eie, and rotten at the core. But so long as wee carie about with vs the old man, and dwel in these houses of clay, we are continually subiect to these diseases of the soule, and will we nill we, we shall often wound our consciences, and make our selues sicke with sinne; the which our bodilie health is so far off from helping and curing, that oftentimes it occasioneth, and most commonly increaseth these spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diseases; in regard whereof one saith, a sicke mind dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth<note place="margin">

And therefore little cause haue we to bragge of this bodily health, being in it selfe vaine, fraile and imperfect, and besides alwaies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the soules sicknesse, which is so dangerous and grieuous, that nothing can cure it but the blood of Christ.</p>

Yea, who findeth not great dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude betweene himselfe being sicke, and himselfe inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfect health? how deuout he is then, how fearefull to offend God, how watchfull ouer his waies, how readie he is to cal himself to a reckoning, that he may set things straight betweene God and himselfe.

               <p>It is lawfull then in some cases to keepe companie with<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. In what cases it is lawfull to come in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie with wicked men.</hi>
                  </note> wicked worldlings. As for example, when humane socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and common ciuilitie doth require it; neither is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to liue in a common wealth, vnlesse we obserue the rules of ciuilitie, and performe mutuall duties of citizens, and neighbours one to another, whether they be professours of religion, or but meere worldlings. For without this, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all trading, buying, selling, and such other commerce, wherewith the Common wealth is maintained and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, decaieth, and quite ceaseth; but euen duties required necessarily to the preseruing of life, and of our being in the world, should also be neglected. As then euery man ought in the time of a common plague, to preserue his health, by keeping himselfe from comming amongst infected persons; and yet in some cases, his comming neere them is nor onelie lawfull, but also necessarie, as to quench a fire, to helpe a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in her labour and childbirth, and to minister vnto them such necessaries, as may preserue their liues; so is it lawfull in these, and such like cases to come into the company of those who are spiritually infected with the plague of sinne. But the company of wicked men is to be auoided, in respect of neere friendship and familiar conuersation, when as wee take delight to frequent their company, as it were, of our owne choice, neither ciuill conuersation, nor humane neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie vrging vs thereunto.

               <p>But as it is lawfull for all men in some cases, to come into the companie of wicked worldlings, so for some men espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially more frequently, namely such as hauing a calling of God hereunto, are furnished also with such a measure of<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4.

                  </note> grace, knowledge, and sanctification, that they may iustly conceiue more hope of conuerting them vnto God, then there is feare that the other should peruert and corrupt them with sin; if withall in sinceritie &amp; vprightnes of heart they propound vnto themselues this as their chiefe &amp; maine end, &amp; not worldly &amp; sinister respects. For as it is lawfull, yea lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, for the Physitians of the bodie, to frequent the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of them who are sicke of infectious and contagious diseases, that they may cure and recouer them, especially when as they doe not goe armed onely with their desperate boldnes, but vse good preseruatiues and wholesome meanes, to preuent and repell the infection; so also it is lawfull for the spirituall Physitians of the soule, to come into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of those who are sick of the leprosie of sinne, and the plague of a scandalous life, if they vse the good meanes of meditation, prayer, and such other wholesome preseruatiues, whereby they may be kept sound from the tainture of this spirituall infection. And for this we haue our Sauiour Christ himselfe for our president, who being the Physitian of our soules, frequented the companie of publicans and sinners, who had most neede of his helpe. For howsoeuer it is not so fit for vs, as it was for him, to come into such companie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was free from sinne, and from the tainture of al cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and therefore needed no preseruatiues, but what he had in himselfe; and also because through the puritie of his nature he was able purely, and without any worldlines and wickednes, to propound those ends of doing others good,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:10731:104"/> and of sauing them from their sinnes; whereas wee being full of the corrupt humours of sinne, and of the seedes of all wickednesse, are apt to receiue the outward infection; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can wee purely without the mixture of our corruption, propound such good ends to our workes and actions; yet seeing it was done by our Sauiour Christ, it is not absolutely vnlawfull in vs; so that we endeuour to do it in his manner, and to the same ends, vsing all good meanes to preserue our selues from hurt, whilest wee labour after others good. For seeing by the rule of charitie wee are bound to loue our neighbours as our selues, it followeth that we may lawfully hazard a slippe or foyle (in the meane time vsing all good meanes whereby we may be enabled to stand vpright) if we haue any hope that by our helpe our brother may be pulled back from the gulfe of destruction whereinto he is falling. Howbeit in this case circumspection is to be vsed, lest whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest wee labour to raise others vp, wee our selues doe catch a downfall, and whilest wee endeuour to cure their diseases, we our selues be tainted and infected with their contagion. For such is our pronenes to fall into this sicknes of the soule, that vnlesse wee vse all good preseruatiues, they will not bee bettered, and wee shall become much worse, and bring our selues into grieuous, but yet vnpitied, diseases. For as the sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> saith, <hi>who will haue pitie of the charmer that is</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And thus haue I shewed in what cases the companie of<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 5. In what cases the companie of wicked world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings is to be condemned.</hi>
                  </note> worldly and wicked men is lawful and warrantable; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by also it is easie to gather in what respect it is vnlawfull and condemned; namely, when it is vsuall and familiar, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie and not of any necessitie, or vrgent occasion, rash and desperate, without vsing any meanes whereby we might be preserued from being corrupted by their societie. And finally, when as wee doe not in vprightnes of conscience, propound as our maine end their spirituall good, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion vnto God, but our owne worldly ends; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, when wee aime by our familiar acquaintance with

               <p>In all which cases and respects, the companie of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings is a notable tentation to draw vs vnto sinne, and to hinder vs in the course of vertue and godlinesse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is most carefully of all Christians to bee shunned and<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6.

                  <hi>a chiefe cause of all our euils, because we liue after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the multitude, and are not composed and ruled by reason, but are carried away with custome; and whereas if few should doe it, we would not imitate them, when as many begin to doe it, we follow for company, as though it were more honest, because it is more common; and so error, when as it is made publicke and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomable, is esteemed of vs in the place of truth.</hi> Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that seeing examples are admitted of vs in place of rules and precepts, therefore the examples of wicked world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings must needs be very powerfull, both in weaning vs from that which is good, and in alluring vs vnto euill.

Whereby oftentimes it commeth to passe that the godly being spectators of these euill examples, and denying to ioyne with them in their enormities, doe not onely thereby endanger their names to be branded with their obloquies reproches, and disgraces, but also their persons to their violence and furie; as we may see in the example of <hi>Lot,</hi> who though he did in most louing<note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> and humble manner refuse to communicate with the Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites in their sinnes, yet so incensed them to rage hereby, that they would haue laid violent hands vpon him, had not God miraculously deliuered him from their furie.

               <p>And thus haue I shewed the manifold euils which come of wicked company, through their bad examples: vnto which we may adde the hurt which we are apt to receiue by their speeches and communication. In which respect the societie of wicked worldlings is dangerous and hurtfull: first, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that by their speeches they corrupt vs; for being either worldly or prophane, and spent either about earthly things, as profits and preferments, or in vaine mirth, ribauldry, filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, foolish iesting, and such like wicked discourses, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe that by frequenting their company we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as worldly as they, hauing not only our hearts fast nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the earth, but our tongues tuned to the same key, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering nothing but that which sauoureth of the world and worldly vanities; or which is worse, being corrupted with their filthie communication, we in the end grow, if not to imitate, yet at least to like, or not so much to dislike them as we ought: for there is a secret poison in worldly and wicked speeches, which when they are admitted into our eares, infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it selfe into our minds, whereby they being corrupted, do taint also all our speeches and actions; of which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Paul</hi> warneth vsto take heed, <hi>Be not</hi> (saith he) <hi>deceiued,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor 15. 33.</note>
                  <hi>euill words corrupt good manners:</hi> or if they doe not thus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt vs, then of necessitie they do much vex and grieue vs, when as we heare our heauenly Father thus dishonored, and see those, whose company we frequent, running swiftly the<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 8.

               <p>Secondly, the speeches and familiar communication of wicked worldlings, are hurtfull and pernicious; as they are the diuels spokesmen to wooe our hearts from God, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, alluring and inticing vs to withdraw from him all true
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:10731:112"/> obedience, by neglecting the duties which he requireth, or committing the vices which he hath forbidden: for we are to know that in this regard worldly men are very impudent, not sticking in plaine tearmes to blow the trumpet of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion against God; and when they cannot catch vs with their wicked company, nor allure vs by their euill examples, they stay not heere, but in direct speeches solicite the diuels suite, either discouraging vs from vertuous actions, by telling vs that they are needlesse, or too troublesome, either that they will not stand with our credit, but traduce our names, and impeach our reputations, or that they are against our profit and preferment in the world, or else prouoking and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, yea alluring and incouraging vs to commit with them sin and wickednesse by all manner of perswasions, inticing speeches, faire promises and kind vsage: by which baits they labour to draw all who frequent their company into the snares of destruction and perdition.

But that we may resist such wicked al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements, let vs know that they are but Syrens songs which intice to leape into the sea of destruction, and but the worlds

                  </note> tentations, which arise from the persons of wicked worldlings, both in regard of their societie and friendship. Now wee are to proceede vnto those which are grounded vpon worldly things; al which by the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> are referred to three heads, to wit, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuousnes, whose obiect are vnlawfull and immoderate pleasures; couetousnes, whose obiect are riches; and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whose obiect are honours and preferments. <hi>All</hi> (saith he) <hi>that is in the world, as the lust of the flesh</hi> (that is, voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes) <hi>the lust of the eyes</hi> (that is, couetousnes) <hi>and the pride of life,</hi> (that is, ambition) <hi>is not of the Father, but is of the world.</hi> And these are the chiefe things which Satan, and the world vse, as their alluring baites and inueigling snares, wherewith they allure vs vnto sinne, and withdraw our hearts from God, and the loue of spirituall things: these are those bands wherewith they tie our hearts fast vnto the earth; these are the Idols which they set vp in our harts with which world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings (forsaking the true God) commit grosse idolatrie, by louing and trusting in them more then vpon Gods power

               <p>Against which tentations it behoues vs to bend all our<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. That these worldly things honours, riches, and pleasures are in their owne nature good, and the gifts of God.</hi>
                  </note> strength, if we would not be ouercome; and to put on all the spirituall armour prescribed in Gods word, wherby we may be inabled to make resistance. But lest in auoiding one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame wee runne into another, reiecting the creatures of God, because of our owne corruption, and leauing the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vse, because of the vnlawfull abuse; I will shew what these things are in themselues, and what vnto vs; in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects they are to be loued, desired, and vsed as good; and in what respects to bee contemned and reiected as euill; how they are to be accounted Gods blessings, &amp; how the worlds baits to allure vs vnto sinne. All which I will shew, first ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, &amp; then particularly. For the former we are to know, that all these three, to wit, honours, riches, and pleasures, are in their owne nature good; for they are the good creatures and gifts of God, which were approued by his owne testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie; where it is said, that <hi>God saw all that he had made, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 30.</note>
                  <hi>loe it was very good.</hi> And lest we should thinke that together with man, they also haue lost all their goodnesse through his fall; the Apostle speaking of the creatures, as they are now in their owne nature, saith, that <hi>euery creature of God is good, and nothing ought to bee refused, if it bee receiued with thanksgiuing.</hi> To this purpose one saith: <hi>These things O Lord</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 4. <hi>Haec tua sunt, bona sunt, quiae tu bonus ista creasti nil no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum est in ijs, &amp;c.</hi> Aug. in ciuit. dei. lib. 15. cap. 22. Pro. 22. 4.</note>
                  <hi>are thine, and they are good, because thou the chiefe goodnes hast created them; there is nothing of ours in them, but that we sinne in ouermuch louing them, inordinately preferring the creatures before thee who hast created them.</hi> Yea they are not only crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Gods making, but also blessings which he promiseth vnto those that serue him, as temporall rewards of their loue and obedience. For so the Wise man saith, <hi>that the reward of humilitie &amp; the feare of God, is riches, &amp; glorie, and life;</hi> where pleasures also are inferred, without which life is no life. Neither hath any but the faithfull any true right vnto these gifts of God, but are meere vsurpers, seeing they do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:10731:118"/> the condition of Gods donation, in louing, fearing, and seruing him; and to those only belongs the right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, vnto whom the blessing also appertaineth. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Lord hath bestowed these his gifts vpon his seruants to good vses and ends, namely, that he might be glorified in them, and they furthered and incouraged in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all good duties. And therefore needs must these things be good, seeing they are good creatures, gifts and blessings, created and bestowed by our good God, on good and faithfull men, and that to good ends and purposes.</p>

By reason of which mutabilitie they are not good in any high degree of excellencie, but to bee reputed among such good things as are of meanest esteeme, as being of an indifferent and low qualitie and nature, in comparison of spirituall and heauenly things. Neither doe they vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably hold this degree of goodnesse which they haue, but as the Chameleon changeth her colour according to the thing vnto which it adioyneth; so they hold their vertue and goodnesse whilest they are in the possession of the good and vertuous; but become euill to the euill, and readie instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all manner of sinne and wickednesse, whilest they are vnder the gouernment of the wicked and vngodly. So that in respect of vs these things are neither good nor euill,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:10731:118"/> but of an indifferent nature, good to those who vse them well, and euill to those that abuse them vnto sin, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they are bestowed of God indifferently both to the good and euill.

Let vs labor to haue all things vnlike worldlings within vs, but let our outward countenance and shew agree with them: let not thy clothes glitter, let them not be sluttish; let vs not affect to haue siluer plate deepely inlayed and imbossed with gold: neither let vs thinke it a signe of fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to want gold and siluer: Let vs studie to lead a better life then the common sort, and not a contrarie; otherwise whilest we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to amend them, we shall driue them away, and turne them from vs: yea it will hereby come to passe, that they will imitate nothing in vs, whilest they feare lest they should imitate all things.

And first wee are to know, that if we would haue these earthly things good, we must labour that they may serue a good master, and that we who are owners of them may be truly iustified, sanctified, and the adopted sonnes of God, who in Christ haue recouered that right and dominion ouer the creatures, which we lost in <hi>Adam;</hi> for if we be not the children of God and heires of his promises, we haue no title to his goods, but intrude vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by vsurpation: if wee continue vnregenerate and defiled in our sinnes, we shall taint these blessings of God with our corruptions, and turne them into sinne; and if we who gouerne and dispose of them be euill, we shall imploy them to euill seruices, and making them to accomplish our euill ends and purposes, we shall cause them to be vnto vs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and pernicious. Foolish therefore is their practise, who labour to haue euery thing good about them, and neglect goodnesse in their owne persons, and seeke to excell all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in all good things which they possesse, themselues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining euill and destitue of all goodnesse, seeing through their corruption they will defile these gifts of God, and of blessings make them to become curses, and notable hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of their saluation.</p>

Finally, let them so esteeme and vse these outward things, as that they may not withdraw their mind from the desire of heauenly loue; and that they do not take away the griefe of our pilgrimage, seeing they should onely serue for some small comforts in the place of our banishment, nor cause vs so to reioyce in these transitorie things, as though we had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnto happines, seeing as long as we possesse them, we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of those ioyes that are eternall.</hi>

As therefore if being pilgrimes, which cannot liue happily but in our owne countrie; and being distressed in this

And then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so will we not be much troubled, though we faile of them when we seeke them, or haue them taken from vs when we possesse them: so that in stead of them, the Lord giueth vs his spirituall graces, and assureth vs of his heauenly ioyes; as not thinking it much to want these trifles, when wee are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with those incomparable treasures, and gifts of farre better value.

               <p>And thus haue I shewed the lawfull vse of these worldly<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 11. Of the lawfull vse of these earthly things, in regard of our possessing and disposing them.</hi>
                  </note> blessings, in regard of our esteeming, louing, and seeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them. Now we are also to adde something of their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vse, in regard of our possessing and disposing them; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the more full handling hereof, till I come to speake of the particulars. And to say nothing of those former points of esteeming and louing them, which are common both to the seeking and possessing of these things, because it is easie for the discreet Reader to apply it also to this purpose; wee are further to know, that if we would haue a lawfull vse of these things, so as they may indeed be blessings of God vnto vs, then must we in the first place sanctifie them vnto our vse by the word of God and prayer; according to the Apostles<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 4.</note> rule, <hi>euery creature of God is good, being sanctified by the word of God and prayer;</hi> by the word, as it doth shew and warrant the right vse of it, so as it may be done in faith, and by prayer,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:10731:123"/> as it is a meanes to deriue Gods blessing vpon it, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the assistance of his holy spirit, wherby we are inabled to vse it aright, and according to Gods will reuealed vnto vs. Secondly, we must not when we haue these things, <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to our owne nets,</hi> as the Prophet speaketh; nor ascribe<note place="margin">Habac. 1. 16.</note> the praise either to our owne merits, or to our industry and labour; for this were to rob God of his roiall prerogatiue, and to take occasion by his gifts to dishonour the giuer; but acknowledging with al humility, that whatsoeuer we haue, we haue receiued it from the Lord of his meere bountie and goodnesse, we must returne vnto him all praise and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, the which is that tribute &amp; homage which our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly King requireth of them, who hold their possessions, by the tenure of his free mercie. And this is one of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Apostle requireth to the making of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture good to our vse; <hi>Euery creature of God</hi> (saith he) <hi>is good,</hi>

                  </note> to speake particularly of the right vse of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, riches and pleasures. Where first we are to know, that honours are of two sorts, the one lawfull and laudable, the other worldly and wicked.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:10731:123"/> The former consisteth not onely in the approbation, which God and our owne consciences giue to eur vertuous actions and good parts; but also in the good opinion, and estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the, vertuous and religious, ioyned with their free ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause and commendation of those gifts, which God hath bestowed on vs; and of those good workes, and honest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and religious actions, which through his grace are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by vs. The which may be either in priuat Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of meane place and calling, or in publicke and eminent persons, ioyned with anthoritie and rule, or other worldly dignities and preferments. The other is the applause and praise of the rude, ignorant, and vnconstant multitude, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with worldly aduancement and preferment, either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by subtill diuices and wicked arts, making shadowes and appearances of vertues and good actions, to stand for those which are true and substantian, or immoderately and ambitiously affected for those things in them, or done by them, which in their owne nature are good and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The former kind of honour is lawfull, and to be desired moderately of all Christians, the other is to bee contemned and despised.</p>
               <p>The lawfulnesse of that honour, and of the moderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. That honour in it selfe is good and lawfull.</hi> 1. Sam. 2. 8.</note> thereof may appeare, first, because it is the gift of God; for it is he <hi>that raiseth vp the poore out of the dust, and lifteth vp the beggar out of the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the seate of glory, as</hi> Hannah <hi>speaketh.</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> acknowledgeth, that <hi>riches and honours come from God, and that it is his hand that maketh great, &amp; giueth strength</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Chron. 29. 11.</note>
                  <hi>to all.</hi> And therefore these streames must needs in themselues be pure and good, seeing they flow from God, the fountaine of all goodnesse, vnlesse they be polluted through the diuels malice, and mans corruption. Secondly, these honours are promised bestowed by God vpon his children and seruants, as his blessings, and rewards of their faithfull seruice. So when <hi>Isaac</hi> blessed <hi>Iacob,</hi> this was one part thereof, <hi>that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should be his seruants, and nations bow vnto him; that hee</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 29.</note>
                  <hi>should be Lord ouer his brethren, and his mothers children should honour him.</hi> To shew vnto vs, that honour and blessednesse
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:10731:124"/> may well goe together, and that we may rule ouer men, and at the same time be the faithfull seruants of our great Lord and Master. Thus the Lord promiseth the people of Israel, that <hi>because they had set vp the Lord to be their God, to walke in</hi>

Yea, in truth a mans fame and good report is to be preferred before life it selfe; seeing the life of an ingenuous and honest man is as bitter as worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, when as he hath outliued his reputation: as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the best life is but short and momentanie; whereas
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:10731:124"/> the fame of the righteous is perpetuall and euerlasting. And this reason the sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> rendreth. <hi>A goodlife</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath the daies numbred; but a good name indureth for</hi>

And howsoeuer we may not chiefly aime at our owne honour in our obedience, but at Gods glory, yet subordinately and in an inferiour place, we may somewhat respect it. Seeing the Lord hath naturally ingrafted in vs a loue of our credit, and a desire to haue a good name among the vertuous, that it might, as a bridle, curbe vs in from running on in sinne, and as a spur pricke vs forward in all vertuous actions. So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith; <hi>Wilt thou be without feare of the power? doe well; so shalt thou haue praise of the same.</hi> And the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that <hi>gouernours are sent of God, for the punishment of euill doers, and for the praise of them that doe well.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth vs, <hi>that if there be any thing of good report, if there be any vertue, or if there be any praise, we should thinke of these things.</hi> Neither is there in truth a greater incouragement on the earth to vertuous and good actions, then the approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and commendation of those who are godly, wise and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious;<note place="margin">Pro. 15. 30.</note> both because it cheareth the heart, and putteth strength to the bones; as also because being often deceiued through our own selfe-loue, which maketh vs to ouerweene our good parts and actions, and to thinke them excellent which are scarce indifferent, we dare not rest in our owne iudgement when we doe well, because it doth so vsually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse vs, and consequently through our timorousnesse and doubting, we are weakened, and made more faint in doing well; but when generally those who are vertuous and iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious doe approoue and commend our actions and good parts, then these feares and doubts being remooued, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:10731:125"/> notable incouragement hereby to proceed in our good courses, and vertuous actions.</p>
               <p>Lastly, from the examples of those who fearing God, haue<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. The lawfulnesse of honours pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the examples of those who haue beene truely ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.</hi> Gen. 23. 6. 2. Chron. 18. 1. Mark. 15. 43. Act. 8. 27.</note> bin highly in his fauour, wee may conclude that fame and vertue, honour and religion may well stand together. As of <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithfull, who was greatly reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced and respected, euen among the Heathen nations; <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi> not onely among the Israelits, but also among the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, and so likewise of <hi>Moses, Dauid, Iosias, Iehosha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat, Ezechias,</hi> and the rest of the godly Kings, with many others. And in the new Testament, we haue the examples of <hi>Ioseph</hi> of Arimathea and <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> Rulers of the Iewes, the Queene <hi>Candaces</hi> Eunuch; vnto which if need were, more might be added; as the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> of whom it is said, that he was <hi>in fauour both with the Lord, and also with</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 2. 26.</note>
                  <hi>men.</hi> Yea our Sauiour Christ himselfe, vnto whom the holy<note place="margin">Luk. 2. 52.</note> Ghost giueth the same testimony: from all which wee may conclude, that honour and estimation amongst men, are in themselues lawfull and good, for otherwise the Lord would neuer haue bestowed them vpon his owne deere seruants, neither would they haue retained them. As also that they are not onely good in their own nature, and as they are the gifts and blessings of God, but euen in the vse of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, seeing we haue hereof so many presidents.</p>
               <p>But howsoeuer honours are good, yet not absolutely and<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 5. That we must first and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally seeke honour from God.</hi>
                  </note> immutably, seeing they are subiect to be abused by mans corruption; and therfore whosoeuer would haue honors tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good vnto them, so as they may haue comfort in inioying them, they must carefully labour to haue a holy vse of them, and to this purpose to obserue many cautions. As first, they must seeke to haue these honours from those that are trulie honourable, and to be praised of those who are praise wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie; and principally because the Lord is the bestower of all true honours, they must seeke in the first place to be approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and praised by him. And to this end they must labour to approoue, not onely their outward actions, but also their hearts and secret affections vnto God, setting themselues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in his presence, and performing all their actions as in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:10731:125"/> his sight: and so walking before God in integritie and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse of heart, they shall shew themselues to bee such<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 29.</note> true Israelites as the Apostle describeth: <hi>He is a Iew which is one within, and the circumcision is of the heart, in the Spirit, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 43. Ioh. 5. 44.</note>
                  <hi>not in the letter, whose praise is not of men but of God.</hi> And not like those ambitious Iewes, who (as our Sauiour saith of them) <hi>loued the praise of men, more then the praise of God:</hi> and<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 20. Act. 24. 16.</note> receiued honor one of another, and did not seeke the honor which commeth of God alone. Now we cannot thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue our selues vnto God, vnlesse we approue our thoughts, words and workes vnto our owne consciences: for as the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> telleth vs, <hi>If our heart condemne vs, God is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

                  <hi>then our heart and knoweth all things.</hi> And therefore in the next place we must with the Apostle <hi>endeauor to haue alwaies a cleare conscience towards God and towards men:</hi> that so it may approue and giue a good testimonie vnto vs. For what will it auaile vs to be commended of men, who are our fellow ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, when as God, who is our Iudge, condemneth vs? What will it profit vs to haue them not onely excusing, but commending and extolling vs, when as our own conscience, which is as good as a thousand witnesses, accuseth and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth testimonie against vs? whereas on the other side, though mē should defame vs, yet we might with the Apostle <hi>reioyce in this, the testimonie of our conscience, that in simplicitie and godly purenesse, and not in fleshly wisedome, but by the grace of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 12.</note>
                  <hi>God, we haue had our conuersation in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus hauing approued our selues vnto God and our<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6.

Howbeit wee are not thus to labour that we may commend our selues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, seeing this is often impossible, in respect of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie of mens iudgements; but next vnto God and our owne consciences, we are to endeauour that we may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued and commended of the godly, vertuous, wise and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious: for these being indued with the Spirit of God, are best able to discerne the things of God, and most fit and competent Iudges of vertue and goodnesse, themselues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">1.

As for the testimonie of the wicked and vngodly, it is not to be desired if we haue it not, nor to be valued and esteemed if we haue it.

                  <hi>abhorre and detest it, it is rather a griefe then a pleasure vnto me; but if I should say that I desire not to be praised of those that liue well, I should but dissemble: if I should say I do desire it, I feare lest I should be more greedie of vanitie then of soliditie: what there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should I say? I neither fully will it, nor fully nill it: I doe not fully will it, lest I should be indangered by humane praises; neither do I fully nill it, lest they should be vngratefull to whō I preach.</hi> As therefore it is the nature of all men to desire praise, so it is the propertie of those who are truly wise and vertuous, to desire this praise of those that are praise-worthie; because wicked worldlings are readie to applaud and commend men when they doe euill, and keepe them company in their vngodly courses: in respect whereof a man hath iust cause to suspect himselfe, and to examine his actions, when impious men commend them.

               <p>And so much for the persons from whom honor and good<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 8. That honour is onely to be desired for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and good actions.</hi>
                  </note> estimation is to be sought: the next thing to be obserued, is, that as we are to seeke it from the good, so also for true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and good actions; for honor is the reward wherewith God crowneth vertue, &amp; his good gifts and graces in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:10731:127"/> and therefore those that take it vpon them, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of these, are but vsurpers who intrude vpon other mens right. As for example, those who desire to be honored for their sinnes and vices, for bowsing and drinking, for rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and wastefull spending, for quarrelling, fighting, reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging wrongs and such like: which howsoeuer they may make men esteemed and well spoken of among wicked men, like vnto themselues, yet nothing maketh them more base<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 15.</note> and contemptible in the sight of God, and of all that are good and vertuous. Secondly, men vniustly arrogat this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor vnto themselues for vanities and things of no worth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth so rich a reward as true honor belong vnto men for euery friuolous trifle: and thus did they who built the tower of Babel to get them a name. And <hi>Absolon</hi> hauing no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues<note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> to eternize his memorie, erected a pillar and called it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his owne name, that hereby his fame might continue to posteritie: and so the Psalmist obserueth, that the wicked imagining that their houses and habitations shall continue for euer, call their lands by their owne names, that so when<note place="margin">2. Sam. 18. 18.</note> their liues end their fame may continue. And thus many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our selues erect goodly houses which they neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit, and stately tombes to lay in their rotten bodies, that<note place="margin">Psal. 49. 11.</note> by these meanes their honor may be preserued, and their fame remaine in after ages. Lastly, they vniustly challenge honors who being destitute of all true good, do put on a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of vertue, and make shew of that goodnesse which they neuer so much as loued or desired, not caring at all to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and religious, but only counterfeit them hypocritical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that by seeming that they are not, they may obtaine that honor and praise which they haue no hope of hauing, if they appeared in their owne likenesse: wherein what do they else but play the imposters and deceiuers, challenging the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and true coine of honor and glorie, for their false and counterfeit wares, worthie in this respect rather to stand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pillery, that al men may take notice of their cosenage, and learne by their example to scorne their base shifts, then to be aduanced into the seate of honor. If therfore we would haue true honor, let vs labour to be that wee seeme, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:10731:127"/> more to approue our hearts vnto God, then our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions vnto men: otherwise our honor being but a shadow of a shadow, vaine in it selfe, and grounded vpon a vaine and false cause, is like but to haue a short raigne; for God abhorring hypocrisie, will in the end pull off the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites vizard, and shewing him in his owne naturall defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, will expose him to the scorne and contempt of all men. And following the Apostles example, let vs desire to haue praise attend vpon vertue and goodnesse, and not go before it, and build it not on the sandie foundation of false shewes and deceitfull colours, if we meane to haue it of any conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, but on truth, honestie, iustice, puritie and the works of loue: <hi>Whatsoeuer things</hi> (saith hee) <hi>are true, whatsoeuer things are honest, whatsoeuer things are iust, whatsoeuer things are pure, whatsoeuer things pertaine to loue, whatsoeuer things</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 8.</note>
                  <hi>are of good report, if there be any vertue, or if there be any praise, thinke on these things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, as we are to desire honor and praise for that which<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 9. That we ought to affect such honours as are moderate and proportionable to our deserts.</hi>
                  </note> is honest and praise-worthie, so in respect of the measure they should be moderate, and in some proportion fitted to our vertues and good parts; for as it is impious to desire praise, for that which is euill; so is it vnequall and vniust, to affect great honors for small deserts, and proud ambition, to desire to be preferred before those who farre exceed vs in vertue and goodnes. In which respect we are carefully to take heed of selfe-loue, which makes vs to amplifie our owne good parts, and in comparison of them to extenuate other mens, and causeth vs to looke (as it were) thorow a truncke of a far vnequall bore, turning the small end to our neighbours ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which scanteth them to our sight, and maketh them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare lesse and fewer then they are; and the great end to our owne, whereby our sight is so inlarged that wee see all and more too. But aboue all things let vs take heed, though we be neuer so excellent, that we suffer and admit those praises only which belong vnto men, not daring or presuming to encroach vpon Gods titles and royalties. In which respect <hi>Herod</hi> offended, when he assumed vnto him the praise due to his Creator; and the Heathen Emperours, whose pride made<note place="margin">Act. 12.</note>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:10731:128"/> them forget their mortalitie, and to aspire vnto diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. And thus (as I take it) doth this flattering age offend, which giues vnto Princes and great personages the highest and most transcendent titles of vertue and goodnes, as most mightie, most excellent, most high, most gracious, most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and such like. Which howsoeuer they may be excused, that they are not giuen them absolutely, but comparatiuely in respect of other men; or that onely thereby is signified, that they are very excellent in these things: yet herein these phrases and titles thus ascribed, admit of no excuse, in that they leaue none that are higher for God himselfe; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men hereby in shew and sound of words match them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with him, which being at least an apparance of euill, Christians ought to auoid. For whereas it may be alleaged,<note place="margin">Psal. 82. 1. 6.</note> that Princes are said in the Scriptures to bee Gods; to this I answere, that this name is attributed vnto them, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of any thing in their persons, but onely in regard of their office and ministerie; because they stand in the place of God, as his Vicegerents and deputies, and therefore they haue his title, seeing they sustaine his person: in which sense also the Lord saith vnto <hi>Moses,</hi> that he had made him <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> God, that is, his owne deputie and ambassadour vnto him. Neither in this respect is this title giuen onely vnto great Princes, but is common with them vnto any inferiour<note place="margin">Exod. 21. 6. &amp; 22. 8.</note> Magistrates, as appeareth in other places. And therefore this title giuen vnto them in respect of their calling and office, excuseth not those, who giue vnto them Gods peculiar at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, in respect of their persons; in which regard if any should giue the title of God vnto any mortal man, he should commit horrible blasphemie, and sacrilegious impietie.</p>
               <p>But as honour ought not to bee sought vnmeasurably in<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 10. That honours ought not to be immoderately desired.</hi>
                  </note> respect of the quantitie; so neither immoderatly, and ouer greedily in respect of our affection: in regard whereof wee should rather haue it pressed vpon vs, then snatch it with violence; and rather stay till it come voluntarily to attend vpon vertue, then to send for it in post hast; or to compell it by force to performe this dutie: for as it is not to be reiected when it proffereth it seruice, so it is not to be pressed hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:10731:128"/> lest we make it slauish and base, which in it owne nature is free and generous. To this purpose <hi>Augustine</hi> aduiseth vs, that we should not wholly accept, nor wholly reiect, all that honour which is offered vnto vs; for he that despiseth all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and fame, for his good parts, and for that which he hath well done, seemeth to abase, and not thankfully to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the gifts of God, which is not agreeable with pietie; and on the other side, he that embraceth all that is offered, doth not a little exceed the bounds of modestie. And as we<note place="margin">

Yea seeing honour is the reward wherewith God euen in this life crowneth vertue, it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as vnlawfull to reiect his gift when hee proffereth it vnto vs, as ambitiously to desire it before it is offered. Which moderation if wee would obserue in our affection, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs first, to obserue this goldē meane in our iudgements: for as on the one side we are not basely to esteeme of honor and a good name, lest we reiect it, whē it is lawfully offered; so on the other side wee are not to ouerualue it, esteeming it of greater worth and excellencie then Gods spirituall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or the glorie of his kingdome, lest the gaining of this which is but imperfect and of momentanie continuance, weane our hearts from that which is most absolute and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
               <p>And if we neither ouerualue it in our iudgements, nor too<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 11. That good meanes onely must be vsed for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning honous▪</hi>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:10731:129"/> that we will vse only good meanes for the obtaining of it: for euen common reason will teach vs, not to hazard things which we esteeme of such infinite value, for the obtaining of those which in comparison wee doe but meanely respect. Whereas contrariwise when as wee ouerprise honours and preferments, and too much set our hearts vpon them; it is a strong tentation to moue vs, to the vse of wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull meanes, for the compassing of them, when as those which are lawfull faile; as wee may see in the example of <hi>Caine, Abimel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And thus ordinarily men offend who affect their owne praises by others dispraises, and grace themselues by the disgrace of their neighbours, treading vpon the necks of those, who are better then themselues, that they may serue as steps whereby they may rise into the seate of honour. And so likewise they who labour to aduance themselues by Machiauellian poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, treacherie, falsehood, hypocrisie and deceit; not caring how dishonest the means be, nor how foule the way, so they may at their iourneys and come to the palace of honour, and attaine vnto the glorie of the world. But among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I cannot omit that vsuall course of bribing, so much practised in these daies; whereby men blush not to aspire vnto all preferments, although it were so odious euen to the very Heathens, who had nothing but the light of nature to guide them, that they made lawes against this ambition, condemning him who aspired by gifts to honours and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, in an hundred peeces of gold, and with perpetuall infamie and disgrace. And yet among vs who professe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie,<note place="margin">Lex Julia.</note> no way so commonly leadeth to the palace of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as this siluer streete. But if we would haue our honours lawfull, so as wee may haue true comfort in enioying them, we must auoid all these wicked courses, and vse onely those meanes which are lawfull and honest for the procuring of them.</p>

                  </note> truely good and lawfull, we must, when we haue them, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them to good vses, and make them serue not onely for the aduancement of Gods glory, of which I haue already spoken, but also to the good and saluation, both of our neighbours and our selues; as namely, wee ought to vse all the loue, authoritie and credit which we haue with them, as cords to pull them backe in the headlong course of sinne, and as allurements to intice them to follow our example, in those vertues and good parts, for which we are so commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. And for our selues, when wee consider that God by furnishing vs with his gifts and graces, hath made vs not onely esteemable in his owne sight, but also honourable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men; let this rich reward make vs to yeeld vnto God all thankfulnesse and obedience: let this our credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation make vs carefull in auoiding all sinne, whereby our honour will be blemished and impeached; and let this gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of earthly honour serue to incourage vs, more cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to run on in our Christian race, that so also we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that precious and heauenlie crown of euerlasting glory.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I set downe the cautions which are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 15. That lawfull honours are to be desired for Gods glory.</hi>
                  </note> vnto lawfull honours, which being obserued, they are good and warrantable; and therefore to be moderatelie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired if wee haue them not, and duly esteemed if wee haue them. Neither is it to be esteemed true humility, but stupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and senslesnesse, not to be affected with the sweet odour of a good name. And howsoeuer ambition, vaine glorie, and worldly and carnall honours, are to bee contemned of all Christians, as we shall afterwards shew, yet these lawfull ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, fame and reputation, wherein the former conditions are obserued, both in compassing and vsing them, may, yea ought to be desired and esteemed, seeing they tend to Gods glory, the good of our brethren, and the furthering of our owne saluation. For when as we shine gloriously in the eies of men, in the light of a godly life, then is our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glorified, as our Sauiour telleth vs; both because hee is<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:10731:131"/> the author and fountaine of all these graces and good gifts, and our Lord and Master, vnder whose rule and gouernment wee thus profit in vertue and goodnesse: and also because whatsoeuer praise we haue of men, we thankfully returne it vnto him. Euen as contrariwise when as we dishonour our<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 14.</note> selues by our sins, we also cause the name of the Lord to be blasphemed and euill spoken of by those who are strangers to his grace. And therefore though there were no other reason moouing vs to seeke this honour and good report, yet this were sufficient, that by it our heauenly father is also glorified, though we did not respect our fame, for our owne sakes, yet for Gods sake we must respect it, because our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit doth also tend to his dishonour.</p>
               <p>So also wee are to desire and esteeme this lawfull honour<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 16. That we are to desire lawfull honours for our neighbors good: and first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thereby he doth his dutie.</hi> Rom. 12. 10. 1. Pet. 2. 17.</note> for our neighbours good; first, because performing a dutie inioyned them by God, they are also made partakers of his promises and rewards; for the Lord requireth in the fifth Commandement, that we should honour them who are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour vnto vs in gifts, and that wee should acknowledge and giue due respect to his graces wheresoeuer wee find them; and in the ninth Commandement, that we should be carefull in preseruing the fame and reputation of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; the Apostle also chargeth vs, that <hi>in giuing honour, we striue to goe one before another;</hi> and that we <hi>should honour all men, loue brotherlie loue, feare God and honour the King.</hi> And to his Commandement the Lord hath added the promise of long life, as a type of life euerlasting, and the earthly Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, as a pledge of our heauenly inheritance, of which it is a most manifest signe that we are heires, when as we loue, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and respect the children of God, for those gifts and graces which wee see shining in them; as appeareth in the fifteenth Psalme, where it is made a marke of one that is to inherit Gods Kingdome, <hi>to contemne a vile person,</hi> or a des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate sinner, <hi>and to honour them that feare the Lord.</hi> And<note place="margin">Psal. 15. 4.</note> therefore when our neighbours doe thus respect and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vs, for our vertues and good parts, we are exceedinglie to reioyce, not onely in respect of God, because his will is done on earth, or our selues, because wee are adorned with
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:10731:131"/> this crowne of vertue; but also in regard of our neighbours, from whom we haue this honour, because they performe that dutie which God requireth of them, and thereby mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that they shall be partakers of his promises, and heires of euerlasting life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are to desire this honour and good esteeme<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 17. We must desire lawfull honour that our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour may be thereby edified.</hi>
                  </note> for our neighbours sake, that hee may thereby bee edified, when as he not only seeth our good example, but also liketh and approoueth it; for it is a notable degree to the imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of goodnesse in a mans selfe, when he beginneth to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reuerence it in another. Besides, there is alwaies with this honour and respect, great authoritie ioyned in the partie who is thus honoured, ouer him who yeeldeth it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, which is not forced, but willing and voluntary; and this is very effectuall and powerfull to draw men vnto all good and religious courses, because it procureth audience and respect vnto their words and perswasions; and therfore we ought carefully to maintaine our honour, that so we may also preserue our authoritie, for the good and edification of our brethren, in which respect, the Apostle chargeth <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to preserue their credit from contempt, that so<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 12. Tit. 2. 15.</note> hauing more authoritie with the people, their ministerie might be more effectuall to perswade them to imbrace the truth, and follow good and vertuous courses. Whereas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise when a mans credit is impeached, and his good name blemished, hee loseth al authoritie and meanes of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good: either by perswading to that which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, or indisswading from sinne; seeing no man is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receiue his physick, of whom the fame goeth, that he hath long had the same disease, and cannot cure himselfe.</p>
               <p>Lastly, as we are to preserue our good name and credit for<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 18. That we must preserue our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and good name to auoide scandall.</hi>
                  </note> the edification of our brethren; so also to preserue them from scandall, lest taking offence at our liues, in regard of the ill rumours they heare of vs, they also grow to dislike our profession and religion. The consideration whereof should mooue all Christians, to an earnest care of preseruing their good name and reputation, not onely by auoiding sinne, but also all appearances of euill; because in this case supposed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:10731:132"/> euils, rumours and iealousies do as much offend our brethrē, casting downe the weake, grieuing the strong, and hardning those who are not called, as those which are truly and really committed. And thus it appeareth that we ought to haue<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nobis necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria est vita no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straa, lijs fama nostra.</hi> Aug. de bon. viduit. cap. 22.</note> great care of our fame and reputation, in regard that it is a notable meanes of our neighbours good. To which purpose one saith, that a good life is necessarie vnto vs, and a good name necessary vnto our brethren: and as we must labour to haue a good conscience before God, so also to haue a good report among men for our neighbours sake: and therefore cruell and vncharitable is their conclusion, who affirme that they will approue their actions to God and their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and not at all care what men speake or thinke of them, seeing the wounds which they suffer in their reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without euer warding them off, do through their names pierce into the consciences of their neighbour, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wound their soules to the very death, for which Christ Iesus shed his precious blood.</p>
               <p>And as we ought to seeke this lawfull honor and good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 19. That we ought to desire honour for our owne sake, that it may reuiue and refresh vs. Hec duo secte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, nitorem bonae conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae et odorem bonae famae.</hi>
                  </note> in regard of God and our neighbours, so also in respect of our selues: neither is it enough that we haue the shining brightnesse of a good conscience, vnlesse wee haue also the sweet odour of a good name: because by this sweet perfume, not only the standers by are refreshed, but also our owne spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits reuiued, and our hearts cheared, so as we may with more comfort and courage hold on and proceed in our good cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: for as not only the sight or remembrance of the crowne or prize, but also the applause of the standers by refresheth the spirits, and giueth strength to the limmes of those who run in an earthly race; so also in the running of our spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all race, not only the remembrance of the crowne of glorie, which they that run shall obtaine, but also the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the godly and faithfull doth exceedingly reuiue and strengthen vs, to continue cōstant in our course vnto the end. And therfore considering how weake and faint we are, in so much as we are daily readie in our selues to slacken our pace, stand still, or turne back againe; it behoueth vs to desire, and much to esteem this and all other good incouragements and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:10731:132"/> comforts, whereby we may be strengthened and helped for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in running this Christian race of righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>Againe, we are bound by the Commandements of God,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 20. That we are bound by Gods Commandement to preserue our honour and good name.</hi>
                  </note> to do all that we lawfully can to obtaine a good name, and to preserue our honor and reputation among men: for wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we are commanded to honor our parents, vnder whom are vnderstood all superiours, whether it be in gouernment and authoritie, or in Gods graces, gifts and vertues; we are also inioyned to haue the like care of our own honor, when there is this superioritie in our selues, because charitie beginneth<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 14</note> at home; and our owne loue is the rule of that loue which we owe to others: whereof it is that the Apostle chargeth <hi>Timothie</hi> that he should not despise Gods gifts bestowed on him. And so also, whereas in the ninth Commandement, God requireth that we should neither hurt, nor yet be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the fame and good report of our neighbours: it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so commanded that we be alike carefull to keepe our fame and reputation, without blemish or impeachment; or else we transgresse the commandement of Almightie God, and wound our owne consciences with sin: for as he is guiltie of the breach of the sixth Cōmandement, who is wanting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himselfe, in the meanes of preseruing his owne life, and of the seuenth who doth not vse all good means to preserue his owne chastitie; so likewise of the fift and ninth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who hath not a lawfull &amp; laudable care of preseruing his own honor and reputation. And hereof it is, that because neglect of our fame is a sinne, and sin is Satans snare, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he catcheth &amp; intangleth vs; therfore the Apostle saith, that a Bishop <hi>must be well reported of, euen of them which are</hi>

And as the Lord bestowed riches as his gifts, benefits and blessings, so he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that they should be offered vnto him againe in sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and oblations, and vouchsafed vnto them this honor, to haue his <note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 35. 5. 6.</note> Tabernacle and Temple made and adorned with them.

               <p>But howsoeuer these riches are good in their owne nature,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. That riches are mutablie good, and of no great excellencie.</hi>
                  </note> and as they proceed from God the fountaine of all goodnes, yet they are not absolutely and immutably good, but subiect to alter their nature according to their owners, and to bee corrupted and abused by mans sinne, who hath them in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session: and therefore howsoeuer they are good, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the degree of their goodnes they are but of low and meane nature, and of little worth and excellencie, if they be compared with Gods spirituall graces, or the eternall ioyes<note place="margin">1.

For howsoeuer the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted these creatures of God good and profitable helpes, for the performance of the workes of mercie; yet comparing them with the spirituall riches of Christ and all his benefits, he esteemed them no better then drosse and dung, yea losse in respect of the other. And this may further appeare in that the Lord doth appropriate his spirituall graces as his chiefe iewels vnto his owne children and seruants; whereas he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth riches as common gifts both to the good and bad, and more commonly and in greater measure to wicked world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, then to those who truely feare him.

                  <hi>and gold haue I none.</hi> So another saith, that riches are giuen by God both to the good and euill, lest they should be thought euill, or a good of any excellent nature. <hi>If</hi> (saith he) <hi>gold and siluer were giuen only to the good, they might rightly be thought to be of some eminent goodnesse: and if they were only wanting to the euill, pouertie might seeme a great punishment.

And howsoeuer vertue and true godlinesse doth not consist chiefely in the outward fact, neither are any excluded from it through the want of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things; for a man is to be esteemed bountifull who hath a bountifull heart, and is esteemed of God a liberall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor to the poore, who hath a large mind and a readie hand to giue, though it be out of small abilitie, as appeareth by the example of the poore widow casting in her two mites, and in Christs promise of reward to him that should giue but a cup of cold water to any of his disciples: yet herein rich men haue a priuiledge aboue others, in that they haue meanes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse and shew their bountie, and to giue a visible testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of their inuisible vertue, in actuall relieuing of the poore, whereby they outwardly receiue much good, and the giuers
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:10731:135"/> inwardly much comfort. And thus the Apostle would haue<note place="margin">2.

A wise man wil not despise himselfe, though he be of a dwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish stature, but yet he would rather chuse to be of a manly and tall pitch; he will shew the power of his wisdome in a<note place="margin">Senec. de. vit. beat. cap. 22.</note> wearish body, or hauing but one eie, but yet he would rather haue a body strong and perfect, and yet so, as knowing that he hath a stronger thing within him; hee can beare with sicknes, but he wisheth health.

Finally, these riches are to those that vse them well, not only good in themselues, but also pledges of Gods loue, and of our eternall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in his kingdome; for they who haue been faithfull in

               </p>
               <p>And thus it appeareth that riches are the good blessings<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. The reason of the following discourse.</hi>
                  </note> of God, to those that are good, and haue also a good vse of them. The which point may seeme to neede little proofe, or enforcing in this couetous age, wherein the most men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme riches their chiefest good, and seeke more earnestly after them, then the glorie of God, or the saluation of their owne soules; but yet because Satan is readie to bring vs from one extreame to another; and as he doth vse all alluring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements, to cause worldlings to fix their hearts vpon them; so when he hath to deale with a weake Christian, whose af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are weaned from the world, hee contrariwise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth him to hate these gifts of God, and vtterly to reiect them, as being in themselues vnlawfull to be possessed. And finally, because there haue been some so farre deluded with these tentations, drawing them to this extreame, that they haue not only condemned the vse of riches, and affected vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie pouertie, but also haue perswaded others to doe the like; as among y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Heathens <hi>Crates</hi> a Philosopher at Thebes, a man of great riches, who when he went to studie Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie at Athens, cast a great treasure of gold into the sea, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hee would destroy it, lest it should destroy him; whose practise <hi>Hierome</hi> approueth, who also being possessed<note place="margin">Hieron. ad Paulinum tom. 1.</note> with this conceit, runneth much on this string, abasing ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and magnifying pouertie: and in our times diuers or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:10731:136"/> among the Papists, as the begging Friars, the Heremits, and Anchorists doe religiously abstaine from the vse of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and professe voluntary pouertie: It shal not therfore be amisse to adde some thing more concerning this point, that those who maintaine this errour may be conuinced, and the weake conscience confirmed in the lawfull vse of these gifts of God.</p>
               <p>Let this then bee the position, that Riches are not to bee<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 7. That riches are not to be reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, because they are the blessings of God.</hi>

And this appeareth, because they are the gifts and blessings of God, which cannot bee contemned and cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, without contempt to his maiestie who bestowed them, vnlesse it be in some cases in which himselfe requireth it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, they are (as I haue shewed) the instruments of doing good, especially of Christian beneficence, and therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing those meanes granted vnto vs by God, we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously to reiect them, but to vse these talents to the glorie of our great Lord and Master who hath intrusted them to our vse. So our Sauiour Christ doth not bid vs to<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 9.</note> cast them away, but to make vs friends of them, by liberall bestowing them to charitable vses, that so we may be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into euerlasting habitations.

Yea contrariwise the holy Ghost teacheth vs to pray against pouertie, as being in it selfe so farre from a state of perfection, that it is euill, and both a cause and fruite of sinne: so the wise <hi>Agur</hi> prayeth, <hi>Giue me not</hi> (saith he) <hi>pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, lest I bee poore, and steale, and take the name of my God in vaine.</hi> And so farre is he from inioyning this wilfull pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that he commandeth vs to labour and take paines in our lawfull callings that we may haue sufficient, not onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 28. 2.

               <p>But they obiect, that our Sauiour Christ and his Apostle calleth riches the mammon of iniquitie, thornes, which

To which I answere, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in calling them so, aimeth not at riches as they are in their owne nature, the gifts and blessings of God, nor as they are possessed and vsed by the faithfull to good purposes; but as they are abused by wicked worldlings vnto sinne, either by their vnlawfull getting of them, or as in their possession they are puffed vp with pride, or trust in them more then in God himselfe; or finally as they commonly abuse them, as their instruments, to accomplish and bring to passe their wicked designes.

For as one saith, <hi>There are some rich whose wealth doth not lift them vp in pride, but exalt them by the workes of mercie; and there are some who abounding in worldly wealth, doe not seeke after the true riches which are of God; neither yet are in loue with their eternall countrie, because they thinke it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for them to be supported with these temporall things. And therefore it is not wealth that is in fault, but the corrupt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For all things that God created are good; but he that abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his goods, behaueth himselfe like the glutton, who through greedinesse killeth himselfe with that foode, wherewith his life should be preserued.

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:10731:137"/> of their disposition doth place them in the number of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate rich men. Whomsoeuer therefore the loue of life eternall doth not humble, the Scripture accounteth him in the number of the wicked rich; because when God shall come to iudgement there will be no difference, whether wee are puffed vp with our goods, or with our dispositions and affections.</hi> But being well vsed they cease to be in respect of our vse of this indifferent nature, and<note place="margin">Eccles. 13. 25.</note> become truly good vnto vs. For as the sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> saith, <hi>Riches are good vnto him that hath no sinne in his conscience, and pouertie is euill in the mouth of the vngodly.</hi> And the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man could say, that howsoeuer riches are blind if they haue not the eye of prudence to illuminate them, yet they see<note place="margin">Plato.</note> acutely when they follow wisedome.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they obiect that a Christian man is to follow<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 9. In what sense the Apostles are said to haue forsaken all.</hi> Mat. 19. 27. Luk. 18. 28. Phil. 3. 7. 8.</note> the example of Christs Disciples who forsooke all, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Christ. I answere, that the Apostles were said to haue left all, first in regard of their estimation, when in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ and his benefits they lightly esteemed them, and (as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> professeth) reputed them no better then dung. Secondly, in regard of their hearts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, when as they did not adhere vnto them as before time, but contemned them as base in respect of Gods spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall graces, and heauenly treasures. Thirdly, in respect of their disposition, resolution, and readinesse to leaue all, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they would denie Christ and the profession of the Gospell. In which respects our Sauiour likewise requireth that we should forsake, yea hate, our father, mother, wife, and children, yea that wee should denie our selues, and hate our<note place="margin">Luk. 14. 26.</note> owne liues: not that he would haue vs to doe thus absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that were to sinne against Gods commandements, but comparatiuely rather then wee should denie Christ and the profession of his Gospell, when both the loue of these earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things and our loue towards them, will not stand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And in the same sense our Sauiour requireth that wee should forsake our riches: for the Apostles themselues who are said to haue forsaken all, did notwithstanding after this retaine their goods in their possession; howsoeuer in regard of their extraordinarie calling whereby they were tied to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:10731:137"/> goe out of their Countrie ouer all the world to preach the Gospell, they had not the daily vse and comfort of them. For after that <hi>Leuie</hi> is said to haue left al, and to haue follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Luk. 5. 28. 29.</note> Christ; in the next words he is also said, to haue made Christ, and many with him, a great feast at his owne house, the which he could not haue done, if he had forsaken all, in<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 27. &amp; 4. 20. 22. &amp; 8. 14. Ioh. 21. 3.</note> respect of right and possession, but onely in the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects. And <hi>Peter</hi> also who saith, that he had forsaken all, retained still his house at Capernaum, with other necessaries and prouision, as were fit to giue vnto Christ intertainment. And so likewise, he had his nets and boates, and other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries for his fishing, euen after the resurrection of Christ, as <hi>Iohn</hi> recordeth. And therefore of necessitie, their leauing and forsaking of all, must be vnderstood, not absolutely and actually, but comparatiuely in respect of their estimation, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and resolution of putting it in practise, when as they should be called thereunto of God. In which regard, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so are bound to forsake all, not only in disposition but in act; first, in case of Christian apologie and profession of Gods true religion, when we are by persecutors put to our choice, either to leaue our riches, or to leaue Christ and his truth.<note place="margin">Matth. 10. Luk. 14. Mark. 8.</note> In which respect also wee are to leaue our liues, as our Sauiour himselfe in many places requireth. Secondly, when it concerneth the generall good of the Church; for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and publicke good is to be preferred before our owne priuate and particular. And lastly, when as in time of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous persecution, the necessitie of many of our brethren is great, and cannot be supplied by any other meanes, then by selling away of our possessions, that the money may bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied to the common vse, as was the case of the primitiue<note place="margin">Act. 2. &amp; cap. 5.</note> Church in the Apostles times.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they obiect the saying of our Sauiour Christ to<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 10. The saying of Christ to the yong man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</hi> Mat. 19. 21.</note> the young man: <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, goe sell that thou hast, and giue it to the poore, &amp;c.</hi> I answer, that this was but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular triall which our Sauiour tooke of this young iusticia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, who bragged that hee had obserued and kept the whole law of God; whereby our Sauiour shewed him how farre he was off from that perfection of righteousnes which God
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:10731:138"/> therein requireth, in that he had not profited thus farre, as to preferre God in his loue and affection before his riches, but would rather leaue Christ, then leaue them, if he must needs forsake one of both. That so being admonished of his owne imperfections and wants, he might flee out of himselfe, and abandoning his owne righteousnesse, he might rest himselfe wholly vpon Christ and his righteousnesse, for his iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; saluation. Finally, they obiect the saying of our Sauior, that it is easier for a camel to goe through the eie of an nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,<note place="margin">Mat 19. 24.</note> then for a rich man to be saued. But the answere is easie; for our Sauiour speaketh not of the possession of riches, but of their abuse, when as rich men trust more in them, then in God. For so he expoundeth himselfe vnto his disciples; <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, how hard is it for them that trust in riches, to enter into</hi>

In the next place we are to consider of those manifold cautions and conditions which are required vnto this lawfull vse, whereby they are made truly good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs; and these are of three sorts: for either they respect the acquisition and getting of riches, or their possession, or final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their administration, bestowing, and imploiment. And first, in respect of their acquisition and getting, it is required that it bee christian, iust and honest. In which regard wee must not who professe by our religion, that wee haue better hopes, giue our selues vp wholly to the scraping and raking of wealth together, suffering our thoughts, our words and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:10731:138"/> actions to be altogether spent about this subiect, as being the maine end at which we aime. But considering that they are not good absolutely, nor in any high degree of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and perfection, but of a meane and indifferent nature; we must giue them their due place, and neither in our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment esteeme them, nor in our affection loue them, nor in our practise seeke them aboue their deserts, or before Gods spirituall graces and heauenly excellencies. But as wee are<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 7. 8.</note> in our iudgements, when they come in comparison with these, to despise and contemne them, and in our affections to loath them, esteeming them no better then drosse and dung, in respect of Christ and his benefits; so neither are we in our acquisition and seeking of them, to giue vnto them the first place, but according as our Sauiour commandeth, wee must <hi>first seeke the Kingdome of God and his righteousnesse,</hi> and then<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 33.</note> without any great care of our owne, God will also minister these things vnto vs. And if this bee not obserued, riches which are in their owne nature good, doe degenerate and become euill: for as a slaue is of good vse whilest he keepeth his owne place, and imploieth himselfe about his owne bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, but becommeth intollerable, when hee presumeth to seate himselfe aboue the King, and taketh vpon him to rule the Commonwealth: and as the seruant is to be well estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of his master, whilest in all humilitie he doth his dutie, but becommeth odious, when he takes vpon him, not onelie to rule him and the whole house, but as a riuall wooeth his mistresse, and withdraweth her heart and affection from her husband; so riches are good, whilest they hold the inferior places of slaues and vnderlings, and be at the owners com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to performe all good duties: but when they presume to seate themselues in the roiall throne of God, the heart of man, which hee hath appropriated to his owne vse, if they take vpon them to rule their owners, and to make them to become their drudges: if being in comparison, of a base and contemptible condition, they exait themselues in our estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aboue heauen and heauenly things; and begin to wooe our hearts from God, and our husband Iesus Christ; then they degenerating from their owne nature and condition
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:10731:139"/> are to be despised, and with iust contempt, to bee trodden and stamped vnder foot.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in gathering of riches wee must vse moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. Riches must not be immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately affected and desired.</hi>
                  </note> both in regard of our affections, and also in respect of the quantity of the riches themselues. In respect of our affection in seeking, wee must first auoid that purposed resolution of worldly men, of becomming rich. For vpon this will follow a desire of vsing vnlawfull meanes, when as lawfull are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and so whilest we get wealth, wee shall lose our soules, and lie open to all Satans snares of tentations, when they are couered with the alluring bait of profit.

For the desire of money, is the roote of all euill, which while some lusted after, they erred from the faith, and pearced themselues thorow with many sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes.</hi> There must therfore be in our wil &amp; desire, a Christian moderation and indifferencie, whereby we wish to attaine vnto riches, if God grant lawfull meanes, and can be content to be without them, if these honest and iust meanes be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Secondly, as our desires must be moderate, so also our hast in compassing them, being content to stay our time, and to waite the Lords leisure, till hee blesseth our labours with fruitfull increase; for otherwise, if as soone as Satan hath set out a bootie, we presently goe a forraging, and runne vpon it without feare of any danger, we shal suddenly fall into his ambushments, and by ouer hastie pursuit of our pray, make our soules a pray to this destroying enemie. And of this the Wise man forewarneth vs, that wee may auoid these strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems of the diuell: <hi>He that</hi> (saith he) <hi>maketh hast to bee rich shall not be innocent.</hi> And a little after: <hi>A man with a wicked</hi>

                  <hi>the beginning, the ena thereof shall not be blessed.</hi> Of this hast therefore let vs take heed, and before we sease vpon riches, let vs consider well of the meanes whereby they are to bee compassed, and seriously view them before wee swallow them, lest Satan hath hid a hooke vnder this baite; and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:10731:139"/> riches are thornes let vs not suddenly catch hold of them, lest they wound our hands, but take hold of them daintilie, and with great warinesse. Thirdly, wee must seeke<note place="margin">Pro. 27. 20. 30. 15.</note> them with quiet and contented minds, and rest satisfied with that proportion which God alotteth vnto vs; and not seeke after them, with an vnsatiable appetite, which the more it hath, the more it coueteth, like those who are sicke of the dropsie, who the more they drinke, the more they thirst; or like the horseleaches, the graue and hell, of which <hi>Salomon</hi> speaketh, which crie, giue, giue, and are neuer satisfied. But of this I shall speake more afterwards. Lastly, we must affect the attaining of riches onely by such meanes as are lawfull, and warranted in the booke of God; that is, we must seeke them in a lawfull calling, and by honest courses, not at all coueting them, when as we cannot thus attaine vnto them. In the former respect it is required, that we liue in a lawfull calling, and therein that we get our riches, and not by play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gaming, and such like courses, condemned by the lawes of God and men. Neither must we labour after wealth, by incroaching vpon other mens callings; for it is not lawfull for a minister to inrich himselfe by following the calling of priuate men, no more then it is lawfull for them, to inrich themselues by taking vpon them the calling of a minister. But euery man ought to abide in that vocation wherunto he is called of God, as the Apostle requireth. And for the other,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 20.</note> we ought in this lawfull calling, to vse onely lawfull meanes to attaine vnto wealth, expecting and waiting for Gods blessing vpon them, and not after the fashion of the world, vse those which are wicked and vnlawful, when those which are lawfull faile. As for example, wee must auoid violence, wrong, oppression, extorsion, crueltie, as also all manner of fraude, deceit, and craftie courses, whereby wee circumuent and endamage others, to inrich our selues. For as the sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> saith, <hi>Riches are good to him that hath no sinne in his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 13. 25. and 31. 8.</note>
                  <hi>conscience, and the rich man is blessed which is found without blemish.</hi> Whereas contrariwise, those who seeke to compasse riches by euill courses, what doe they els but flee from God, and seeke to haue their desires satisfied by the diuell? What
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:10731:140"/> do they but by gaining a little earthly pelfe, hazard their own saluation, <hi>&amp; what wil it profit them to gaine the whole world and to lose their owne soules?</hi> as our Sauiour Christ speaketh. To<note place="margin">Mark. 8. 36.</note> this purpose the Heathen Philosopher speaketh excellently: <hi>A wise man</hi> (saith he) <hi>may haue great riches, being not wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Senec. de bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta vita, cap. 23.</note>
                  <hi>taken from any, neither defiled with strange blood, gotten without iniurie, without any dishonest courses; of which there is as honest a passage and egresse, as they had an entrance, at which none groneth and repineth but the enuious and malicious: let them be sifted and examined as much as you will, and they will proue honest. In which when as there are many things, which all could desire to be their owne, there is nothing which any man can say it is his owne: such an one will not reiect the benignitie of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, and will neither glorie nor blush in his patrimonie gotten by honest meanes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And as a wise man will not admit a peny ill gotten to come within his doores; so he will not refuse and cast out great riches, the gift of prouidence &amp; the fruit of vertue. For why should he enuie them a places let them come and spare not, let them take vp a lodging with him: he will neither boast of them, nor hide them; for that were a signe of a mind ignorant how to vse them, this of a mind base and fearefull, as though he hugged in his bosome a thing of great price. He will not (I say) cast them out of doores. For then what should he say, are you vnprofitable? or doe not I know how to vse you? but as though he could go a iorney on foot▪ yet he had rather go in his coach; so if he can lawfully be rich, he will, and will haue wealth in his custodie, but as a thing which is light and readie to flie away: neither will he suffer it to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome either to any other or himselfe, but he will bestow it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the good, or to those whom he is in hope to make good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much concerning the moderation of our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. Of the quantitie of riches which is to be desired, that is, so much as is necessarie.</hi>
                  </note> in seeking riches: in the next place we are to consider of the quantitie of our riches which is to be desired and sought after: in which regard riches are either necessary, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and plentifull, or abundant and superfluous. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of riches either respecteth a mans nature or his state: the necessitie of nature is, that a man haue things necessarie to sustaine and preserue nature, as food, apparell, lodging and such like, with which a man must rest contented if he
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:10731:140"/> haue no more: according to the Apostles rule, <hi>If wee haue food and rayment let vs therewith be content.</hi> And these neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 8.</note> euery man is bound to desire and seeke after, both that<note place="margin">1. Thes. 4. 12. 2. Cor. 12. 13.</note> nothing be lacking vnto him for the preseruation of his life, and also that he be not chargeable vnto others. The necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of state, place or calling, either respecteth himselfe or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Vnto the former is required that a man haue not only things fit to sustaine nature, but to maintaine him according to his place and calling; in which a greater or lesse proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is necessarie, according to the dignitie or meanenesse of a mans qualitie or condition. And thus a noble man hath need of a large allowance to maintaine him according to his nobilitie, and a King more, to maintaine his royaltie: and thus besides necessaries belonging to nature, scholars &amp; stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents haue need of bookes, and artizans of tooles. In respect also of others, riches are necessarie either to maintaine those which are committed to a mans charge, or others who are not vnder his gouernement: for the former, the father is bound to maintaine, not only himselfe, but also his children, the master his familie, the Magistrate his officers; of which a man ought to haue as great a care to prouide them necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries according to their seuerall conditions as himselfe; and therefore is bound in conscience to desire and seeke after the meanes, whereby he may be enabled hereunto. For as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, <hi>If there be any that prouideth not for his owne, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 8.</note>
                  <hi>namely for them of his houshold, he denieth the faith, and is worse then an Infidell.</hi> And this care was in <hi>Iacob,</hi> where he saith to <hi>Laban, When shall I trauaile for mine owne house also?</hi> and in the<note place="margin">Gen. 30. 30.</note> good huswife described in the Prouerbs, who was diligent to prouide necessaries not only for her husband and children,<note place="margin">Pro. 31. 15. 21.</note> but also for all the rest of her family: yea this care was in our Sauiour Christ himselfe, who had a purse to keepe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which was fit for the common store, both for himselfe, his disciples, and the poore; which as one obserueth, was not a peny-pouch, but a bag so bigge that it needed a bearer. And this prouision of necessaries ought not onely to be for<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 29. &amp; 12. 6.</note> the time present, but also for the time to come: for the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of which lesson the sluggard is sent to the Pismire to

               <p>The second degree or measure of riches, is to haue not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. That it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to desire sufficient plenty.</hi>
                  </note> things necessarie, but also to haue some sufficiencie and reasonable plentie of them; so as a man may haue not onely wherewith to hold life and soule together, and to prouide in some poore and slender manner for his charge and familie, but also such store, as that together with them that depend vpon him, he may liue comfortablie and cheerefully in his<note place="margin">2.

And not only so, but also may be inabled thereby, to be liberally helpefull and beneficiall vnto others, and to aduance their good, whether it be priuate or publike.

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:10731:142"/> good. And in this degree also riches may lawfully be desired and sought: first, because the holy Ghost doth account this plentifull estate in it selfe more happie, then that of want, whereas it is said by Christ himselfe; that it is a blessed thing<note place="margin">Act. 20. 35. D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, because we are taught by the example of <hi>Agur</hi> to pray for this sufficiencie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient<note place="margin">Pro. 30. 8.</note> plentie. And lastly, because God requireth of vs that we be ready to performe those good duties both publike and priuate vnto others: as namely, that we must not only drinke of the water of our owne cesterne our selues, but also <hi>must let</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 5. 15. 16.</note>
                  <hi>our fountaines flow forth, and our riuers of waters must run into the streets;</hi> and not only labour to sustaine our selues and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, but also <hi>that we may giue vnto him that needeth.</hi> Vnto<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 28.</note> which we might adde all those commandements inioyning, and exhortations incouraging vs to giue vnto the poore, and to do the workes of mercie to those who need our helpe; as also to giue tribute to the Prince, and maintenance to those who labour in the worke of the ministery: all which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly proue the lawfulnes of desiring and seeking this suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of riches and conuenient plenty, so it be with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and with obseruance of the former cautions; for where any duty is commanded, there also the meanes whereby we are inabled to performe it, are inioyned so farre forth as we can compasse them by lawful meanes. Vnto which we might also adde, that the Lord in his infinite bounty and goodnes, hath not only created such plentifull store of these his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as are sufficient for necessitie, but also for honest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort<note place="margin">Leuit. 26. 5. Deut. 28. 2. 3. 4. 11. 30. 9.</note> and delight, and hath in many places promised this store and plentie to those that feare and serue him.</p>
               <p>The third degree of riches is abundance and superfluitie,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 5. Whether it be lawfull to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire abundance of riches.</hi>
                  </note> whē a man hath more thē is fit for his place &amp; calling, or thē he can or wil imploy to any good vses. Now the questiō here is, whether it be lawful for a Christian man to desire &amp; seeke after this abundance and superfluitie? For answering wherof we are to know, that this desire and seeking of abundance is to be condemned as vnlawful, not simplie and absolutely in it
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:10731:143"/> selfe; for if we could desire and seeke abundance of riches,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Cor. 9. 6. 7. 9.</note> which are in themselues good, by good and lawfull meanes in a moderate manner, in respect of our affection, and vnto good ends, namely, that according to our proportion of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches we might abundantly glorifie God, and disperse that which we thus gather vnto the poore, and were made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by more thankfull vnto God, according to the measure of his gifts, and more humble because we are more indebted vnto him, I do not s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e how this desire should be vnlawfull; for if we may lawfully vse this abundance when God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth it, it cannot be that it is simplie and absolutely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to desire that which we may lawfully vse. But yet this desire of abundance by accident and by reason of our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is euill and vnlawfull; because they who desire abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance doe immoderatly desire it, and oftentimes vse euill meanes in seeking to compasse it. Secondly, because in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of our corruption wee cannot propound purely those ends of doing good, but desire and seeke it for selfe-loue, and for our owne vse. Thirdly, because we desire more then we can, or will imploy to good vses, neither is the fault in the quantitie of our riches, but in our inordinate desires, and vniust detention of them from good vses: for if we had such an euer springing fountaine of wealth that could neuer be drawne drie, there were no hurt in it, if wee would retaine thereof onely so much as might suffice vs, and serue for our owne necessarie and lawfull vse, letting all our superfluitie run abroad the countrie for the reliefe of others, and for the refreshing of such poore afflicted soules as are dried vp with griefe and pouertie. For so although we should haue alwaies abundance, yet should we neuer haue superfluitie, because we haue no more then we well vse. Fourthly, because desiring and seeking abundance, we do accordingly take paines in vsing the meanes, whereby we may attaine vnto our desires; and consequently our thoughts and labors being of no large extent, are wholly taken vp in these earthly imployments, so as in the meane time we neither desire nor seek as we ought things of far greater excellēcie, as Gods spiritual graces, and the eternall ioyes of his kingdome. And lastly, in respect of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:10731:143"/> our corruption this abundance of riches and wealth is the foundation and ground of many dangerous tentations; whereby Satan choketh in vs the seed of Gods word, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs from the loue of heauen and heauenly things, puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth vs vp with pride, and maketh vs forgetfull of God, and of all duties which we owe vnto him. So that like as our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, whē they excessiuely abound with any humour, though it be neuer so good in it selfe, they are thereby cast into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate diseases, if it bee not purged and abated; so it fareth with vs in respect of our states, for when they abound with superfluitie of these good things which are earthly and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and are not abated by imploying them to good vses, they make our soules dangerously sick in sinne, and betray them to bee ouercome by the tentations of the diuell. And therefore as the discreet Merchant, though his wares be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so good, fitteth his burthen to his ship, not ouerloading it with more then it can well carrie, for feare lest all should sinke; and if a storme happen, is readie to lighten his ship, by casting out a part of this also, that so the residue with himselfe may escape the danger; so wee are to vse the like wisedome, and not ouerburthen our mindes and soules, with a greater loade of these earthly things, then they can well beare, but allow only vnto them a fit and competent propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if Satan taking aduantage of our plentie, doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger vs with the stormes of his tentations, we are to ease our selues by giuing part of that, which otherwise we might well vse, to the poore, to preserue our soules from suffering shipwrack, and so shall we not only saue the rest for our own<note place="margin">Eccles. 11. 1.</note> vse, but casting our wares <hi>vpon the face of these waters, we shall after many daies finde them,</hi> with no small aduantage.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I shewed that howsoeuer abundance is<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. That it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for vs to desire superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi>
                  </note> good in it selfe, yet in many respects the desire thereof is hurtfull vnto vs. The which may further appeare by these reasons. First, because riches are not absolutely good, but in respect of the end, or vse, for which they are desired and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, according to which end they are to be measured and proportioned; for those things which are good in respect of their end, are to be measured according to this end. As for
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:10731:144"/> example, the end of our desiring riches is, that by their vse, wee may glorifie God, haue sufficient maintenance for our selues, and be able to relieue others, and consequently our desires are only so farre lawfull as they are measured and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to these ends; for in all those things whose goodnesse consisteth in a due measure and proportion, either the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease or diminution of this measure must needes be euill. And therefore to desire more riches then wee either can or will vse to Gods glorie, for our owne maintenance, or the reliefe of others, must needs be euill and vnlawfull, because our desires exceed the measure of those ends, for which only riches are good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this desire of abundance, not thus to vse it, but<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 7. Desire of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie a signe of diffidence and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> to hold it in our own possession, and to make our selues rich, is a notable signe of diffidence and distrust in Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and prouidence, which maketh men think that they haue neuer sufficient for their maintenance, and for the preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all casualties and dangers of losse, which may befall them, although they haue alreadie one foote in the graue. Thirdly, abundance immoderately affected and accordingly obtained and possessed, is a notable meanes to puffe men vp with pride, to make them to forget God, to insult ouer their brethren▪ as wee may see in many euen in our daies, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nothing in themselues worth regard, but being mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably poore in all vertue, wisedome, and goodnesse, are yet exceeding proud of their riches, and insult ouer all who are inferiour vnto them in wealth, though they bee neuer so much superiour in all graces and good parts. And this was the cause why the Lord did forbid euen Kings themselues to<note place="margin">Deut. 17. 17.</note> gather much siluer and gold, lest their hearts being puffed vp with pride, they should be turned away from God. Now if Kings whose royaltie is so great, and whose imployments so manifold, both for maintenance of their estate, and for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of themselues and their countrie, might not seeke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue riches, and superfluous abundance; how much more vnlawfull is it in subiects and inferiour persons, who haue no such vse of it?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that which wee may not pray for, that wee may<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 8. We may not pray for abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it.</hi> Pro. 30▪ 8. 9.</note>

Yea rather wee are taught to pray against it, according to the example of wise <hi>Agur; Giue me not riches, lest I be full and denie thee, and say, who is the Lord:</hi> and our Sauiour Christ hath taught vs to pray, not for abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and superfluitie, but for our daily bread, that is, such necessaries and conuenient store, as may comfortably su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine our liues; and also that we should not be led into ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: now in respect of our corruption this abundance is a notable tentation and snare of the diuell, whereby he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs from the loue of God, and fastneth our hearts vnto the earth, besides innumerable other euils, which thereby hee worketh in vs; and therefore we who desire to be deliuered from tentations, are not wilfully and desirously to runne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Lastly, this desire and seeking of abundance for our owne vse is iniurious and hurtful to our brethren and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; for seeing these earthly things are circumscribed, and but of a finite nature; therefore it must needs follow, that the more that some abound with them, the more others want.

As therefore the flye when she doth but touch and taste the honey receiueth no hurt, but is thereby fed and nourished; but if she doe ouer greedily runne into it, is intangled and perisheth: so if wee moderately affect a competencie and sufficiencie of earthly riches, they tend to our good and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation; but if with too much eagernes wee wallow in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance and superfluitie, in stead of receiuing any good we intangle our selues, and hasten our destruction.<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 9.

So also hauing abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of riches, if we doe not set our hearts vpon them, then will we bee content to leaue them, when as God the chiefe owner calleth againe for them; if wee lightly esteeme of them whilest we haue them, then wil we but slightly mourne for them when they leaue vs, neither shall they take away any thing from vs but themselues, leauing contentment, ioy, and comfort, which we haue chiefly in God, behind them. And as we will not reiect them when we haue them, seeing they are the gifts of God, so when they take them to their wings, and flee away, we will looke after them with a quiet mind, and a carelesse countenance.

               <p>Finally, we lawfully possesse riches, when as wee keepe a<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 12 That we must carefully take heede lest our riches become Satans baites and snares.</hi>

               <p>And so much concerning the lawfull possession of riches.<note place="margin">§. Sect. 13. Of the lawfull vse of riches in respect of their disposing and bestowing.</note> The last thing required to their lawfull vse respecteth their administration and bestowing; and this is, that they be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon good, iust and charitable vses, the which either respect our selues, who possesse them, or other men to whom they ought to be communicated. The vse which respecteth the owners themselues is, that they imploy their riches to the good, preseruation, defence and comfort, of themselues, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their person, estate and calling; and also of all others, who are committed to their charge and gouernment. And vnto this two things are required, first, parsimonie or thriftines, wherby we honestly spare our goods, and preserue them frō being wastfully and riotously consumed. Secondly, frugalitie, wherby we honestly spend our well gotten goods soberly, and moderately vpon our owne good and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vses, for our profit and honest delight.

The former vice, as it is hurtfull to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, so especially to him that is corrupted with it, seeing like a theefe he robbeth himself of the vse of his own goods, and as well wanteth that he hath, as that he hath not; but of this I shall haue occasion to speake hereafter. The other is the immoderate wasting of a mans goods; when as he spends these blessings of God lauishly, and aboue his ability, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

Both which are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be auoided, for as the one hath not, that he hath, so the other will not haue it long, vnlesse he rake from others a new supplie by vnlawfull meanes; in which respect, as the sordidous person is a thiefe because he robbeth himselfe; so the wastfull spender is a thiefe, because hee robbeth other men, and one while is gripingly coue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So also our riches are lawfully vsed and imploied, when as they are bestowed for the publicke good of the Common-wealth; as in the maintaining of the roiall estate of the King, by tributes and customes, in defending our<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 21.</note> Countrie in time of warre, in erecting of schooles and hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and such other publicke seruices, whereby the good of<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 6. 7.</note> the Common-wealth is aduanced and furthered. To which purposes we should spare, not only out of our superfluities, but euen from our backes and bellies, when need requires; seeing the common good is to be preferred before our owne priuate, and our Countrie before our states and liues, in that from it we haue had the meanes of our maintenance, yea our

For to this vse we haue receiued them of God, that we should not misspend them in excesse, vanitie and riot; but that as Gods steward, we should imploy them to the honour of our master, and the good of our fellow-seruants. And this was figured vnto vs in the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Manna, of which the Israelites hauing gathered some more, and some lesse, did afterwards measure it with an<note place="margin">Exod. 16. 17. 18.</note> Omer, <hi>and he that had gathered much, had nothing ouer, and he that had gathered little, had no lacke:</hi> As the Apostle also applieth it.

                  </note> In the last place we are to adde something of pleasures, and to consider how farre forth they are to bee desured, as lawfull and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, whereby also we may more easilie discerne in what respects wee are to eschew and contemne them. To which purpose we are to know, that pleasures are of three kinds: the first diuine and holy; the second naturall and ciuill, the third carnall and wicked. Diuine pleasure is, when as we delight in the Lord, and reioyce in the fruition of his gifts and graces in this life, and in our assurance of those heauenly ioyes in the life to come. And vnto this pleasure as being not onely lawfull, but religious, holy, and very commendable, we are in many places of the Scriptures exhorted. So the Apostle willeth him, <hi>that reioyceth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 10. 17. Phil. 4. 4.</note>

                  <note place="margin">1. Thes. 5. 16.</note>
                  <hi>continually:</hi> not onely when we abound in wordly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie, but euen in affliction: for as the Apostle saith, <hi>being</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1. 3.</note>
                  <hi>iustified by faith, and hauing peace with God, we reioyce not only vnder the hope of the glory of God, but also in tribulation.</hi> And<note place="margin">1. Sam. 30. 6.</note> thus <hi>Dauid</hi> comforted himself in the Lord, when as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were readie to stone him: and the Apostles reioyced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">Act. 5. 41.</note> they were counted worthy to suffer rebuke for Christ▪ and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> when they were sore whipped, and put<note place="margin">Act. 16.</note> into a cruell prison.</p>
               <p>And this is that principall ioy and pleasure which euery<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. Diuine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures are much to be desired.</hi>

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:10731:149"/> men cannot rellish, but thinke it tedious and loathsome; yet to those that haue euer truly tasted of it, it is much more comfortable and delightfull then all worldly and wicked pleasures. An example whereof wee haue in our Sauiour Christ, who accounted it meat and drinke to doe the will of<note place="margin">Iohn 4. 34.</note> his heauenly Father: and in his beloued Apostle, who profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, that he had no greater ioy then this, that those whom<note place="margin">Iohn epist. 3. vers. 4.</note> he had begotten vnto God did walke in his truth.

And therefore if our hearts were truly sanctified, and we but a little inured to these heauenly ioyes and pleasures, wee would but a little esteeme the sinfull pleasures of the flesh, which now because we are carnally minded we so much dote vpon.</p>
               <p>The second kind of pleasures are those which are naturall<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. Of naturall and ciuill pleasures, and that they are in their own nature good, but in respect of vs of an indifferent nature▪ and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> they are vsed.</hi>
                  </note> and ciuil, when as we ioy and reioyce in the fruition of Gods temporall and earthly blessings and benefits: the which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is in it owne nature good, but yet not absolutely and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutablie; and in respect of the vse of an indifferent nature, good to the good, who haue a right vse of it, and euill to those who abuse it vnto sinne. Concerning the former; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall pleasures which consist in meats, drinkes, apparel, hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, musicke, recreations, and in the fruition of other Gods comfortable blessings &amp; benefits, are to those that vse them well lawfull, good and commendable. First, because they are the gifts of God which he hath purposely prouided for vs in the creation, and bestoweth them vpon his seruants, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to moue them vnto more chearefull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For as the Psalmist saith, he hath not only <hi>made bread to strengthen mans heart▪ but also wine which maketh glad the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 104. 15.</note>
                  <hi>heart of man, and oyle to make his face shine.</hi> He hath prouided for his children not only things necessarie and profitable, but
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:10731:149"/> also pleasant and comfortable, seruing for their honest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; as appeareth in the varietie of colours▪ smelles, tastes, metals, stones, fruits, beasts and birds: the lawfull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull vse whereof Gods children cannot refuse without contempt, or at least neglect of the Creators bounty. Againe, the Lord hath mixed those pleasures with all our naturall actions, as eating, drinking, sleeping, and the rest▪ that we might be moued to do those things which are necessarie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are also pleasant and delightful. And therefore we are not to reiect and contemne pleasures, seeing they are the bountifull gifts of God▪ but to imploy them so as that they may tend to the glorie of him who gaue them, and to the furthering of our owne spirituall good; neither is their vse, but their abuse only to be taken away. To this purpose one<note place="margin">Gregor. moral. lib. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For what would it auaile vs to be exalted to the seate of honor, or to abound with earthly riches, if we should take no delight or pleasure in them? And this is the Wise

               <p>Thirdly, these naturall and ciuill pleasures which we take<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 5. Naturall and ciuill pleasures serue to good ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.</hi>

And therefore hath the Lord giuen vnto
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:10731:150"/> vs as it were these first fruits, and small taste of his euerlasting ioyes in these temporall delights, to make vs long after those fully-satisfying and neuer glutting pleasures, and to thinke no labour too much for the obtaining of those pure ioyes which are at his right hand for euermore: seeing euen these earthly pleasures though momentany, and mixed with many miseries and much bitternesse by reason of sin, doe leaue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse such a pleasant rellish behind them. Secondly, they inable vs to those duties of Gods seruice, and of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, as they do recreate and refresh vs after our painfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. In which respect they are exceeding necessarie, seeing in regard of our frailtie and weaknes, it were impossible to trauaile in our Christian course, vnlesse we were strengthned and cheared with these earthly baits: for our bodies would be tyred, and our minds made dull and sluggish, if they stood alwaies bent; neither could we long labour if our hearts were not cheared and our spirits refreshed with this sweete▪ oyntment of pleasure and delight.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I shewed that these naturall and ciuill plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. That vnto vs pleasures are of an indifferent nature, holding their goodnesse only when they ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> are in themselues good and lawfull; yet, as I said, they are not good absolutely, immutablie, or in any high degree of perfection. But in respect of vs and of their vse of an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature, holding their naturall goodnesse when they are well vsed, and degenerating into euill, when as they are abused, as causes, meanes, or instruments of sin. And therfore in the next place we are to consider, how these gifts of God which are good in themselues, may also be good vnto vs: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which is required, first that our persons be iustified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled vnto God by a true faith in Iesus Christ: for as we may obserue in the Apostles order, true ioy and reioycing are<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1. 3.</note> the effects and fruits of our iustification and peace with God: without which as we haue no right or interest in these plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, so are they altogether false and full of vanitie, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the delights of a malefactor which he hath betweene the time of his condemnation and execution, or vnto a faire way which bringeth him to the gallowes. As therefore <hi>Iehu</hi> said to <hi>Iehoram,</hi> what peace can there be so long as the whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of thy mother <hi>Iesabel</hi> remaine? So may I say to the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:10731:151"/> wicked man affecting pleasures; what pleasures can there be so long as thy sinnes which oblige thee to eternall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments remaine vnpardoned? But after we haue the remission<note place="margin">2. King 9. 22.</note> of sin, peace with God, and peace of conscience, and in lieu of thankfulnes spend our strength in his seruice, then is the time of desiring these pleasures, that we may the better ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be inabled to these duties. Whereby it may appeare, that these pleasures and delights are not only lawfull to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfull, but so appropriated and peculiar vnto them, as that they belong to none besides them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Psalmist exhorting men to this ioy, doth direct his speech only to the faithfull: <hi>Be glad</hi> (saith he) <hi>yee righteous,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 32. 11. and 33. 1.</note>
                  <hi>and reioyce in the Lord, and be ioyfull all ye that are vpright in heart:</hi> and in the next Psalme: <hi>Reioyce in the Lord, O ye righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, for it becommeth vpright men to be thankefull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, our pleasures must be moderately esteemed and<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 7. We must not ouerualue them, or immoderatly affect them.</hi>
                  </note> affected according to their owne nature and worth, and not preferred either in our iudgements or desires, either before our spirituall ioy in God, or the eternall ioyes of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; with which ioyes when they come in comparison they are to be contemned, and to be loathed and reiected when as they will not stand together. So that if we would haue these pleasures lawfull, wee must neither ouerualue them in our iudgements, nor set our hearts and affections vpon them, which ought to be reserued for those other ioies of farre greater excellencie, but only esteeming and louing them, as the traueller doth the pleasures of his Inne, and the pilgrime those delights which he passeth by in his way: and as the Apostle expresseth it, <hi>reioycing as though we reioyced</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 30.</note>
                  <hi>not;</hi> let vs place our chiefe ioy in the Lord, and principally esteeme and affect that fulnesse of ioy which we shall haue in Gods presence, and those vnspeakeable pleasures, which are<note place="margin">Psalm. 16. 11.</note> at his right hand for euermore.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as we must moderate our affections, so our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 8. Ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. to Gods glorie.</hi>
                  </note> themselues must be moderate: for being not absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, but as they are referred vnto and limitted by their ends: therefore when they exceed these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ust bounds, they degenerate and become euill and vnlawfull. Now the chiefe
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:10731:151"/> and principall end of our pleasures ought to be the glorie of God; when as we therefore vse them not only that we may with all thankefulnesse acknowledge his great bountie and goodnes towards vs, but also may be the better inabled to serue him with all cheerefulnes in the duties of religion and Christianitie; and therefore we must take heed if we would haue our pleasures lawful, that they further this end; and that they doe not take vp that time which is allotted vnto the seruice of God, nor yet be vsed in such excesse and so immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, as shall make vs more vnfit for the performance of these holy duties. In which respect those offend who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the Lords day which he hath set apart for his seruice, by spending it about their owne pleasures and recreations: as<note place="margin">Esay 58. 13.</note> also they who so immoderately vse those pleasures of eating, drinking, exercise and the rest, that they are more fit to sleep, then to serue God in any dutie which he requireth.</p>
               <p>The other end of pleasures is our own good, when as they<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 9. Our pleasures must be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the good both of our souls and bodies.</hi>
                  </note> tend to the preseruation of our health, and to the better fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of vs for all good duties of our callings: wherein this rule is to be obserued, that we doe not so much addict our selues vnto them, as that by their immoderate vse we impaire the health of our soules, nor so much abstaine from them, as that by vtter neglecting them, we ouerthrow the health of our bodies. In which respect it is hard to determine of a iust proportion, seeing the quantity differeth according to the persons, and the callings also wherin they are imployed: for some bodies require more pleasure for the preseruation of their health, and some lesse: some callings are more painfull, spending the spirits and consuming the strength, and some more easie and better indured. And therefore Christian dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion is heere required, that thereby pleasures may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned and fitted to the person and state of him that vseth them: and still obseruing these ends, we are to take heed that we do not vnder pretence of vsing pleasures for our health, abuse them in excesse and surfet of these sweet delights; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing more doth weaken our strength, impaire our health, nor more speedily bring desperate diseases and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death, then the immoderate vse of these pleasures.

                  </note> vs carefully watch ouer our selues in the vse of them, that they be not vnto vs Satans nets of perdition through our corruption, whereby he catcheth and intangleth vs in sinne: neither is there any more vsuall or yet more dangerous baite wherewith he allureth vs vnto sinne, then by offering vnto vs these pleasing delicates of pleasure and delight. And therfore we must not with vnbridled affections rush vpon them; but before we giue them entertainment we must againe &amp; again consider, first, whether they be lawfull, and then how they may be lawfully vsed, carefully referring them to those good ends for which they were ordained, and vsing them with moderation both in respect of our affections, and also of the things themselues. But especially we must take heed that we do not fully rest in these temporall and naturall pleasures, as being our last end and chiefe happinesse; affecting to haue our Paradise in this world; for so they will become the diuels birdlime, in which when we haue wallowed, we shall not be able to mount aloft in heauenly meditations; and notable impediments to hinder vs from the fruition of those euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting ioyes in Gods kingdome: but we must only vse them as helpes and meanes to further and hasten our speed in our spiritual race, and as reasons &amp; motiues to make vs affect that heauenly ioy and pleasure with more ardent loue: conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with our selues, that if these earthly delights bee so sweet and comfortable, then how many, yea infinit degrees more excellent and admirable ioyes shall we haue in heauen, when we shall haue the fruition of God himselfe, and of all those pleasures which he hath prepared for his Saints, and that without the mixture of any miserie or affliction! And thus much concerning the second kind of pleasures which are naturall and ciuill. The third and last kind are carnall and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:10731:152"/> worldly pleasures, as surfetting and drunkennesse, chambe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and wantonnesse, lust and vncleannesse, vnlawfull sports and recreations: all which being in themselues euill and wicked, are not onely to be contemned, but euen hated and abhorred of all Christians.</p>

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:10731:154"/> of all times hath shewed; in so much, as when hee was to encounter our Sauiour Christ himselfe, hee maketh choice of these, as of his most forcible and preuailing wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; inticing him to vse vnlawfull meanes to please his taste, and satisfie his appetite, to get a name, and obtaine the riches and glory of the world. The which, howsoeuer they could not pearce or wound him; in regard that hee was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the armour of proofe, his perfect puritie, and absolute righteousnesse; yet he hath much preuailed with them against all others, so as not any hath escaped vnwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and without foile out of the conflict, but whilest they haue laboured to defend themselues from the force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of one, they haue runne vpon the point of another, and haue exposed themselues vnto danger, euen whilest they thought of auoiding and escaping it.

                  </note> when they are vnited and conioyned, it may easily appeare if we consider, of their perillous strength being singled the one from the other. For first, how manifold and dangerous are the tentations into which honours plunge men, when as they ouerualew, and immoderately affect them; making them to forget all duties which belong vnto God, and to neglect all good offices naturall, ciuill, and religious which
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:10731:154"/> they owe vnto men, without all respect of acquaintance, friendship and kindred, yea of fidelitie and common hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, so they may aspire to their proud hopes, and compasse their ambitious ends; not caring whom they tread vnder foote, so they make their falles steps, whereby themselues may rise. Neither doe these tentations onely take hold of worldlings and wicked men, but euen of the deare seruants of God, as wee may see in the example of the disciples stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for superioritie, and contending one with another, who<note place="margin">Luk. 9. 46. <hi>Non huius ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis vires sentit nisi qui ei bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum indixerit: quia et si cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam facile est laude carere dum denegatur, difficile est eâ non delectari cum offertur.</hi> August. ad Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relium. epist. 64. tom. 2.</note> should be greatest, and haue the highest place in Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

In which respect <hi>Augustine</hi> describeth riches thus: <hi>That they are a costly danger, to those who possesse them; an euill master, and a treacherous seruant; birdlime vnto our spirituall wings, fathers of flatterie, sonnes of griefe and care; a cause of feare to those that haue them, and of griefe to those that want them.</hi>

                  </note> earthly things are vnto vs, seeing they are the grounds and occasions of Satans tentations whereby he allureth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth vs vnto sinne: not (as I haue proued) in their owne nature, but as they are abused through the diuels malice and our corruption, whereby it commeth to passe that wee neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect those cautions required to their lawfull vse, of which I haue before spoken. So that in a word, if wee would know how these things are to be desired, and in what respects they
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:10731:156"/> are to bee contemned and despised; wee are to affect them, when in their lawfull vse they tend to the setting foorth of Gods glorie, the good of his Church, and the furthering and assuring of our owne saluation. And contrariwise we are to contemne them, when as being abused by Satan and our corruption they become tentations, prouocations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of sinne, and consequently notable impediments to hinder our saluation. To which purposes when they serue, and offer themselues vnto vs vpon these wicked and vnequal conditions; wee are not only to despise and reiect them, but also to hate and abhorre them, as being the diuels sollicitors, who by perswading vs vnto sin, cosen and deceiue vs, first of Gods loue and fauour, and then of the eternall saluation of our soules.</p>
               <p>Now as they are thus abused when the former condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 8. These earthly things are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abused when we make idols of them.</hi>
                  </note> are neglected; so especially when as we make idols of them and impart vnto them diuine worship; more esteeming them in our mindes, and affecting them in our hearts, and more speedily and earnestly seeking them in our practise and all our endeuours, then the fauour of God, his spirituall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or the eternall ioyes of his kingdome. Which idolatrie worldly men vsually commit, and in this respect these earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, honours, riches, and pleasures, are said to bee the worldlings trinitie, which they serue and worship in the place of God. And hence also it is that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 5.

And thus the ambitious worldling offendeth, who preferreth his owne honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the glorie of God; and more greedily seeketh the praise of the creature then of the Creator, and the vaine glorie of the world, before the eternall glorie of Gods kingdome.

And thus doe couetous worldlings offend, who more esteeme their gold then their God, and more affect earthly riches, then the spirituall treasures of Gods graces, and glorie in his kingdome; spending more time, and taking more paines to attaine vnto worldly abundance, then for the assurance of their owne saluation. And such an one was <hi>Iudas,</hi> who sold Christ himselfe for money, and made more account of his idoll then of our Sauiour; and <hi>Demas,</hi> who when the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion<note place="margin">2.

To this purpose one demandeth; What (saith he) seemeth delightfull vnto<note place="margin">Chrysost.

And if you will learne this, let vs inquire of one ready to depart this life, or decrepit with old age, and putting him in mind of his worldly vanities, with which in time past he was delighted, and on the other side, of all those good workes, and fruits of pietie, which he hath euer brought foorth in his whole life; and then aske him in which now he doth most reioyce; we shall find that he will be confounded with shame to thinke of those, and exceedingly reioyce, when he calleth these to his remembrance.

Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest we looke vpon these things alone, and vncompared, wee may thinke them of some worth, and such as may deserue our loue in affecting them, and our labour in seeking them; but if euer wee had tasted of these spirituall and heauenlie dainties, we would in comparison of them, loath the other, esteeming them with the Apostle no better then dung and<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 7.</note> losse, in respect of Christ, and the rich treasures of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits: and as those who hauing walked in the bright sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine, can see nothing when they come into darke places; so if with the Apostle, wee had euer seene the glorious<note place="margin">2.

If we could share our hart and affections between God and the world, haue one foot in heauen, and the other fixed vpon the earth, lift one eie vp to these heauenly excellencies, and cast the other downe vpon these earthly vanities; final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, if we could haue both the honour of the world, and the glory of Gods Kingdome, these temporary riches, and those eternall treasures, the pleasures of the flesh, and the ioyes of heauen, there were some reason why wee should esteeme, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:10731:158"/> and seeke both, although with no equalitie, seeing there is such disproportion betweene the things desired. But the Lord hath plainely told vs, that wee cannot serue him and<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 24.

And therefore if we would be partakers of that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall blessednesse, let vs not thinke that we may pursue both with equall affection; much lesse preferre these transitorie trifles before those heauenly ioies, and euerlasting treasures; but counting this one thing necessarie, euen the glorifying of God, in the saluation of our soules, and the fruition of those pleasures, which are at his right hand for euermore; let vs not only basely esteeme these earthly vanities, when they come in comparison with the other; but also hate, reiect and contemne them, when they become the diuels tentations to intice vs vnto sinne, and consequentlie impediments to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vs, in seeking and obtaining this heauenlie happinesse.</p>

In which argument that I may proceed with more profit and perspicuitie; and may more effectuallie cure this running canker, and contagious plague of worldly loue, which hath most perniciously spread it selfe abroad, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:10731:159"/> almost all men, not onely prophane worldlings, but euen those who would be esteemed sincere professours, and sound Christians; I will follow the Physitians methode, and first set downe the symptomes and signes of this disease, and then afterwards the remedies, that so we may know whether we be tainted with this contagion, and if we be, then how to cure it. The signes whereby we may know whether wee be infected with the loue of the world and worldly vanities, preferring them before spirituall and heauenly excellencies are diuers. First, those things which we most esteeme and loue, on those we most often thinke, and that with vnweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed delight and chiefest comfort: for as our Sauiour Christ saith, <hi>there as the treasure is, there will the heart be also.</hi> And<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 21.</note> thus doth the exile take his chiefe delight and comfort, in thinking of his owne Countrie; the louer of his beloued; the ambitious man of honours and preferments; the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man of his riches; the voluptuous man of his pleasures and delights; reuoluing in their minds, either how they may obtaine, retaine, or augment and increase them. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, those who most esteeme and affect heauen, and heauenly things, they take their chiefe delight in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of those vnspeakeable ioyes reserued for them in their Countrie, or of the meanes whereby they may be assured to attaine vnto them. Let therfore euery man examine himself before the tribunall feate of God, and call his owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to witnesse, whether he thinke more, and with greater ioy and comfort vpon God, or vpon the world, heauen or earth, those eternall ioies, or these momentanie vanities. For if God and heauenly things, be the chiefe obiect of our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, then do we esteeme thē our chief treasures, seeing our harts, and affections are set vpon them. But contrariwise, if it be our chiefe comfort and delight, to think on the world and worldly vanities, and if our meditations doe continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly runne on them with vntired wearinesse, taking no pleasure at all to call to mind those spirituall treasures, and heauenly excellencies; or if we chance to thinke of them, this thought be as suddenly vanished, as a flash of lightning; it is a most manifest signe, that our treasures are not in heauen, but vpon
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:10731:159"/> the earth, that we loue the world better then God, and more esteeme of these transitorie trifles, then of that eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse in Gods Kingdome.</p>

As therefore the doore-keeper said vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> thou art surely of Galilee, for thy speech bewraieth thee: so when a man taketh his whole delight in worldly and carnall communication, wee may conclude, that he is a citizen of the world, because his speech bewraieth him: for as when the clocke within is disordered, and the wheeles out of frame, the hammer and bell must needs giue a false sound: so when our hearts are inwardly disordered and corrupted with worldlinesse and prophanenes, our speech outwardly accordeth with them. So the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, that because they are worldlings, <hi>therefore speake ther of the world, and the world heareth them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Iohn 4. 5. Esa 32. 6.</note> Thus as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> telleth vs, <hi>the niggard will talke of niggardnesse;</hi> and thus the ambitious man taketh his chiefe delight to speake of his honours and preferments; the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man of riches, the voluptuous man of his pleasures and delights: In a word, whosoeuer hath his mind chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the worlds musicke, he hath his tongue also tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the same key; and taketh his ioy and comfort in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of nothing, but of the world, and worldly vanities. But on the other side, when once our minds are weaned from the world, and when we haue laid vp our chiefe treasures in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; when we esteeme God our soules sole and chiefe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and with the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> account the Lord our<note place="margin">Psalm. 3. 3. and 62. 7.</note> glory and reioyoing, when our chiefe comfort is in that assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which we haue of our heauenly inheritance, and of the eternall ioies of Gods Kingdome; then doe wee take our chiefe ioy and comfort, in talking and conferring of such
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:10731:160"/> matters as concerne the sauing knowledge of God, then do heauenly discourses replenish our heart with delight, and then is it our chiefe comfort and contentment, to speake of the excellencie and riches of our blessed patrimonie reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued<note place="margin">Sermo est imago animi; qualis est vir, talis oratio.</note> for vs, or of the meanes how wee may further be assured that we shall inherit and enioy it. Let therefore our tongues be the touchstone of our hearts, whereby wee may easily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne whether they be of heauenly mettall or of earthly drosse. And let vs examine our owne consciences, whether we take our chiefe delight and comfort in speaking of these heauenly things, and desire to frequent their company most, who vsually intertaine vs with such diuine discourses; and whether in hearing and talking of them, wee be not glutted with satietie, but rather affected with cheereful alacritie, and tickled with inward ioy. And if we finde that wee can abide this triall, wee may be assured to our comfort, that the Lord is our chiefe loue and delight, and that our treasures are not on earth, but in our heauenly countrie the kingdome of God. But if wee find our selues vnacquainted with this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Canaan, and take no more delight to heare it, then some vnknowne speech: If after a word or two spoken of these spirituall and heauenly excellencies, wee are straight glutted with loathing satietie, and offer occasion of some other talke; it plainly discouereth our inward corruption, and euidently sheweth, that our hearts and affections are not set vpon God, and the riches of his kingdome, but doe chiefly esteeme, and most feruently loue, the things of this life, the world, and worldly vanities.</p>
               <p>But heere some may obiect, that if much thinking and<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. In what sense our much think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and speaking of vvorldlie things are signes of the loue of the world.</hi>
                  </note> speaking of the things of this world, be infallible signes, that wee loue them more then God, and the ioyes of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then who can be acquitted of this corruption, seeing the vsuall matter of meditation, and the most ordinarie theame whereon all men discourse, are their earthly affaires, and the things of this life. To which I answere, that whilest we remaine here, we are more flesh then spirit; and therefore it is no maruell if our discourses be for the most part world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and carnall: but yet wee must take heed that wee doe not
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:10731:160"/> please our selues in our corruptions, but labour to mortifie and subdue thē, and to accustome and inure our hearts and tongues, to meditate and talke of spirituall and heauenly matters, as being of chiefest worth and excellencie. And if we thus doe, then can we not be said to loue the world more then God, although wee talke more of it: for not simplie to thinke and speake more of these things, doth shew that we loue and affect them more, but to thinke and speake of them with greatest delight and chiefest comfort. For seeing the obiects both of our meditations and speeches, are offered vnto them by the ministerie of the senses, it is no maruell though we think and speake more of sensible things, though we lesse esteeme them, the of those heauenly excellencies, which are onely intellectuall, and not subiect to the senses, although we must value them in our iudgements, and affect them with our loue. Againe, our ordinarie callings and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie affaires of this life, do inforce vs ordinarily and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to thinke and speake of them, more then of spirituall and heauenly things; but hereof it followeth not, that wee loue them more then they, for there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene doing a thing often vpon necessitie, and doing it with chiefe comfort and delight. The workman thinketh more of his worke and tooles, the husbandman of his hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandrie, the painter of his picture and colours, then of their beloued wiues and most deare children; but yet it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that they affect them with more loue, seeing the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hereof is, because these things are continually subiect to their senses, and the obiect of their labors and imployments; and not because they most esteeme them in their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we loue those things most, which we most desire<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. The third signe is when we most desire these earthly things, take most care and paines in compassing thē▪</hi>
                  </note> to enioy, and bestow greatest paines and studie to obtaine our desire; for according to the measure of our loue in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, is our zeale in desiring, and our care and labour in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that which we so much affect and desire. And this also is ioyned with an earnest endeuour, to vse all meanes which may further vs, and to auoid all impediments which might hinder vs in attaining vnto that, which with such great zeale
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:10731:161"/> we desire and seeke. Vnto which we may adde an inuincible patience, in suffering and induring all things, for the enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which wee esteeme and loue. <hi>For</hi> (as one saith) <hi>euery wicked worldling is so much more patient and strong, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure</hi>
                  <note place="margin">August. de pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. lib. c. 17. tom. 4.</note>
                  <hi>any euils, by how much the loue of the world doth more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in him; and euery righteous man is so much more constant and couragious to endure any miseries, by how much hee is more inflamed with the loue of God. But the loue of the world hath his beginning from our free choice, his progresse from the delight of pleasure, his strength from the bond of custome: but the loue of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghost.</hi> And thus worldly men aboue all things desire worldly vanities, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no care and studie too much, nor paines too great, for the atchieuing of their desire; tyring their wits, spending their sweate, and strength, yea consuming their bodies, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselues to all dangers, that they may attaine vnto their worldly hopes; in the meane time neuer thinking of the saluation of their soules, much lesse endeuouring to vse those meanes whereby they may bee assured of it. And thus the ambitious man aboue all things desireth honors and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, and consumeth his state, relinquisheth al pleasures, bendeth his whole studies, spareth for no labour, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth himselfe into most desperate perils, that he may attaine vnto them; the couetous man also holdeth the same courses, neglecting his credit, and contemning all delights, that hee may scrape together riches. And the voluptuous man, careth not by lust, surfetting, and drunkennes to make himself more vile and contemptible then a bruit beast; neither spareth he for any cost, but consumeth his estate, that he may spend the time present in delight and sensualitie. And why is this, but because euery one affect their seueral obiects with their chief loue, and therefore thinke nothing too much which either they bestow or suffer for the enioying of them. And contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise, they who like the wise Merchant most esteeme and loue the precious pearle of Gods kingdom, his sauing truth, and the ioyes of heauen, they will not sticke to sell all the world, with the pleasures, riches, and preferments thereof,<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 45.</note> that they may compasse and procure them. According to
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:10731:161"/> this signe therefore let vs examine our loue, whether it be more set vpon God, or vpon the world; and this may easilie be determined, if we consider whether we doe more earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire the fauour and the assurance of our owne saluation, or the fruition of worldly vanities; whether we bestow grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter studie, cost and labour, in seeking after Gods spirituall graces and eternall ioyes, and indure all this paines with more patience; or in attaining vnto the pleasures and profits of this life. Finally, whether wee could be content either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to haue, or soone to leaue, whatsoeuer in the earth is deare vnto vs, if the time of triall should come; rather then we would not purchase the precious pearle, euen Gods loue and our owne saluation. And lest our secure consciences should deceiue vs, with a false conceit of this true loue, let vs further examine it according to the second point, namely, whether with more care and diligence we desire and seeke after those meanes, whereby we may be assured that we shall obtaine these spirituall graces and heauenly happines, which is a liuely faith, with a godly and sanctified life (for sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation assureth vs of our iustification, vocation, election, and consequently of our saluation) or the meanes whereby wee may attaine vnto our earthly desires. And then againe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we doe with more circumspection and indeuour auoid those impediments, which might hinder vs from obtaining the heauenly treasures of Gods kingdom, namely our sinnes and the transgression of Gods commandements, which are that wall of separation betweene God and vs; or those hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances and lets which crosse our worldly desires. And if in these respects our consciences iustifie vs, then doe we surely loue God better then the world; and preferre heauenly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, before earthly prosperitie. But on the other side, if our consciences witnesse against vs, that wee desire more worldly vanities, then eternall glorie; that wee wholly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this, and bestow all our studie, cost and labour in seeking and procuring of the other, that wee can willingly finde in our hearts by committing of sinne to make a forfeiture of our heauenly inheritance, so as wee may obtaine by it some earthly profit or delight; and finally, that we more carefully
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:10731:162"/> auoid the impediments which crosse our worldly desires, then sinne which like a stumbling block in the way hindreth our passage into our heauenly countrie; then doe wee more esteeme, and more dearely loue the world and worldly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, then the Lord himselfe, and the eternall ioyes of his kingdome.</p>
               <p>Lastly, that which we most esteeme and loue, we also take<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 5. The fourth signe is when we take most ioy in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and most griefe in losing them.</hi>

And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ioy in keeping them, such is their feare of losing them, and answerable to both is their sorrow and griefe, when as they are taken from them. On the other side, they whose hearts are inflamed with the fire of Gods loue, doe most reioyce in him, and in the assurance of his loue and mercie towards them; and making most precious account of this iewell, they had rather lose the whole world then Gods fauour, or the testimonies thereof in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Let euery one therefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this signe examine himselfe; and if vpon triall wee finde, that God is our principall ioy, and that wee most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in his saluation; if with the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> wee had rather see the light of Gods countenance shining vpon vs,<note place="margin">Psal 4. 6. 7.</note> then that men should shew vs any worldly good; and when it appeareth, haue more ioy of heart, then worldly men haue

Whereas our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards God and heauenly things are spirituall and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall; and the things which we thus affect diuine and heauenly; in both which respects, they are not so sensible as the other. And therefore the truth of our loue, reioycing, feare and sorrow, about heauenly and earthly things, is not to be measured by our senses, their quantitie, and violence of our passions, but according to their simplicitie and sincerity. But yet if in our sense, or in the quantitie and degree, our ioy in the world exceed our ioy in God, and our sorrow for earthly losses, be more strong and violent, then it is for sin, and the losse of Gods fauour, it cannot be denied, but that it proceedeth from the strength and violence of our naturall corruptions, and that wee haue the like corruption in our loue, which in respect of the ardencie and heate, affecteth earthly things more then heauenly. And therefore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice hereof, that we loue the world more then God, and that wee set our affections more vpon earthly vanities, then vpon heauenly excellencies, we must not rest conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with our imperfections and corruptions, and applaud our selues, because wee haue in vs the loue of God in some measure, and (though not in the heate of our affections, yet) in the soundnesse of our iudgements we more esteeme him, but we must labour earnestly to perfect our wants, and to mortifie our corruptions, and neuer to be at quiet, but still
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:10731:163"/> aspiring from one degree to another, til at last we attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that degree of perfection and sanctification, that wee can loue and reioyce in God, more then in the world, and grieue more for his displeasure, then for any earthly losse, and that both in quantitie and degree, and in our owne sense and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. For otherwise if these affections which we thinke san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and in truth, doe standat a stay, and we be contented with that weake and imperfect measure, hauing not so much as a desire or indeauor, that they go forward and increaso; it is a manifest signe that there is neither truth nor sanctification in them; but that they are false and counterfeit; seeing al true grace is either in the growth, or at least, desireth and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the means, whereby it may grow to more perfection.</p>

                  </note> loue, whereby this dangerous disease may be discouered and knowne; according vnto which if wee examine our selues, I doubt not, but many who through their securitie thought themselues sound, and in good case, shall find that they are desperately sicke of this disease euen to the death, vnlesse they prouide speedily whole some medicines for their recouerie; yea and those who are in the best estate, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out selfe-loue, flatterie and partialitie, they trie their estate according to these rules, they shall plainely discerne, that howsoeuer Christ hath called and culled them out of the world, yet they haue left some part of their heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons behind them; and that howsoeuer through Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie they are pulled (as it were) by strong hand, out of this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Sodome; yet they are ready euery hand-while with <hi>Lots</hi> wife to looke backe, as being loth to leaue their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profits and preferments, and to be weaned from the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:10731:164"/> of sinne, which they haue so long sucked with so great delight. They shall find that they are like prisoners newly deliuered, and freed from their bolts, who by their hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and lamenesse are still put in mind of their old bonds and fetters, that they are like greene and feeble bodies new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recouered of some dangerous disease, that is, weake and void of strength in spirituall graces, and especially in the true loue of God, and his spirituall and heauenly excellencies, and readie to fall into a relapse of their old sicknesse worldly loue, vnlesse they be very watchfull and carefull ouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and keepe a strict and curious diet, neuer feeding vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these worldly vanities, but with great temperance and moderation. And that still there are some relikes of those corrupt humours of worldly loue remaining in them, and remainders of this burning and vnkindly heate, which will extinguish, or at least abate that diuine and spirituall fire of the loue of God and heauenly things, vnlesse that heate bee qualified, those corrupt humors purged, and that vitall flame of diuine loue bee continually nourished with wholesome cordials and restoratiues prescribed in God word. Finally, they shall plainely perceiue, that they are like that harlot, of whom <hi>Hosea</hi> speaketh, who being married vnto Christ, after they haue long time liued in spirituall whoredome with the world, are hardly drawne from their old filthinesse, to which they were so long inured, but are ready continually to affect their old louer, and to renew their fornications and vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; vnlesse they were restrained by their husband Iesus Christ, and by the power of his spirit, word and chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (as it were) by strong hand, held backe from running on in these leaud and wicked courses.</p>
               <p>And therefore as I haue shewed the signes of this disease;<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. Remedies to cure the disease of worldlie loue.</hi>
                  </note> so now in the next place I will prescribe the remedies, and set downe such wholesome medicines as may serue, both for preseruatiues to keepe them sound, who are not yet infected with this spirituall poison; and also for purges to free vs from these hurtfull humors of worldly loue, if they abound in vs, which being applied by the patient, and made effectuall by Gods blessing, may restore vs to health, though through
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:10731:164"/> these tough and noisome humours oppressing vs, wee were brought into a deepe consumption of godlinesse, and euen vnto the very gates of death. And finally, for cordiall resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiues to recouer vs being weake, vnto our perfect health, and confirme and strengthen vs more and more in the true loue of God, his spirituall graces, and the eternall ioies of his Kingdom. That therfore we may not immoderately loue the world and worldly things, but may contemne them when they come in comparison of heauenly excellencies, and that we may not at all affect them, but may hate and abhor them, as they are the diuels instruments and baites to perswade and allure vs vnto sinne; let these reasons mooue vs: first,<note place="margin">The generall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of those arguments which may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade vs from the loue of the world.</note> because there is no cause why we should thus immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loue and affect them, nor thus vnlawfully desire to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe them, in respect of the things themselues which are thus loued and desired. And secondly, because there is no reason hereof in regard of vs, who do affect and couet them. In the things themselues, there is no cause of this immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate loue; first, because though we neuer so much dote vpon and desire them, yet they doe not bring vnto vs any true, substantiall, or certaine good: and secondly, because being thus affected, they become the instruments of much euill; and therefore as in the former respect they are to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned and despised, so in the latter they are to be abhorred and reiected. They doe not bring vnto vs any found and certaine good: first, because they are of no great and desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goodnesse, though we should long inioy them; and also because they are altogether vncertaine, both in the getting and possessing. They are of no great goodnesse vnto vs, though we could for euer inioy them; first, because these things themselues are vaine, and of no great worth or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie; whereupon also it followeth, that they do not satisfie, nor giue vnto vs any true or sound contentment; and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because they are vtterly vnprofitable, and besides mixt and accompanied with innumerable euils, &amp; manifold miseries. For if I shall prooue that there is no cause why we should desire them, either in respect of themselues or vs; that they bring vs no true good, but contrariwise much euill; that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:10731:165"/> as they haue no great goodnesse in them whilest wee haue them, so though they had, yet we haue no assurance of them; that they are vaine, and of no excellencie, and yet mingled with a multitude of miseries; there will bee little reason why we should greatly loue them; and much lesse why wee should preferre them before Gods spirituall graces and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly ioies; or accept of them as Satans wages, whereby he perswadeth vs to serue him by committing of sinne, wherby we hazard the losse of our soules, and of our heauenly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, which are infinitely of more worth then the whole world.</p>
               <p>First therefore wee are to know, that the world and the<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. That the best things the world can boast of, are but meere vanities.</hi>
                  </note> best things which it can boast of, are but meere vanities, and in comparison of Gods spiritual graces, and our heauenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, of no worth or excellencie; neither is there any thing in the earth great or excellent, but the Christian mind which contemneth and despiseth these highly esteemed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. They make a faire shew indeed to those, whose iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are alreadie forestalled with the false conceits of their corrupt flesh, and seeme to be of some value and greatnesse to those who look vpon them through the spectacles of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But if wee pul off their false couers, and seriously and vnpartially behold them after their deceiuing colours and painted vizards are laid aside, we shall find the world in his chiefe beautie and pompe to bee but a glorious hypocrite, faire in shew, and foule in truth, professing and promising much, and performing nothing; or a beautifull sepulcher outwardly adorned with all cost and brauerie, but within full of stench and rottennesse; or like vnto our faire buildings in these times, which making a sumptuous shew to the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers by, seeme to inuite poore men to receiue reliefe; but within haue no prouision for hospitalitie, nor food to refresh those who stand in need. The like vanitie also is in all those worldly things, which are so affected and admired of those, who haue erected them in their hearts, as their idols whom they serue and adore; herein indeed truly resembling idols and images, which are outwardly adorned with gold and precious ornaments, and make representation of some excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:10731:165"/> personage, whereas if you examine them any further then the very superficies and outside, you shall finde them no better then stocks or stones. So these worldly vanities seeme to those whose weake sight can pearce no deeper then the outward shew, beautifull and glorious; whereas in truth if wee could behold them inwardly with the eye of a sound iudgement, wee should easily discerne them to bee contemptibly base, and of no value. In this respect like those goodly and beautifull pageants which being outwardlie adorned and set forth with gold and painted colours, moue multitudes of people to runne after them, and to behold them with ioyful admiration and rauishing wonder; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if you looke into their inside, you shall finde nothing but a few sticks, ragges, and patches; and in respect of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and durablenes so slight and weake, that they are only fit for a vaine shew, and to serue for a daies sport.</p>
               <p>But this vanitie of the world and worldly things may bee<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. The vanitie of worldly things proued by testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi> Psal. 39. 6.

For his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he had for one day thirtie measures of fine flower, and three score measures of meale, which according to the least account is 232 quarters, and according to the estimate of others much more; thirtie oxen, an hundred sheepe, beside<note place="margin">1.

But heare after all his pompe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity what testimony he giueth to all these earthly things, and that vpon his owne experience. <hi>Ʋanitie of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanitie of vanities, all is vanitie.</hi> Yea he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth<note place="margin">Eccles. 1. 2. and 2. 11.</note> afterwards that all is <hi>not only vanitie, but also vexation of spirit, and that there is no profit vnder the sunne.</hi> If a poore man though neuer so wise, or a scholer out of his knowledge and discourse had thus proclaimed the worlds vanitie, it might haue been deemed to haue proceeded from want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, because they had neuer triall of them, or from some melancholike conceit, mouing them to contemne that which they had no hope to enioy. And therefore because we should take no exceptions against this testimonie, it hath pleased the Lord to teach vs this lesson by such an one as had not only most wisedome to iudge of them, but also most trial and experience of all these things, which the world estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:10731:167"/> good, and worth desiring, both in respect of his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and great varietie of them, and his long, secure and peaceable time, wherein he did inioy them; and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mixture of those innumerable troubles, with which other men are vexed and molested.</p>
               <p>And so much for the testimonies which serue to shew the<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. That these worldly things are of no great excellencie, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are but Gods common gifts.</hi>
                  </note> worlds vanitie, vnto which innumerable others might bee added out of writings, both diuine and heathenish; but these being sufficient I will come to the reasons, which also proue it. And first the vanitie and worthlesnesse of the world and worldly things in comparison of those which are spirituall and heauenly, may hereby appeare, in that they are but Gods common gifts which he giueth in his infinit bountie, as well to his enemies, as vnto his friends; to those who neglect all dutie, and rebell against him, as well as to his children and seruants, who loue and feare him. Yea, commonly the Lord bestoweth these worldly things in great abundance vpon the wicked, whereas for the most part he giueth them to the godly and righteous, whom he chiefly loueth, but with a spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hand, and so much onely as may serue for their necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vse. And this <hi>Dauid</hi> obserued, whereas he saith, that his wicked aduersaries <hi>were inclosed in their owne fat,</hi> that <hi>they</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 17. 10. 14.</note>
                  <hi>had</hi> plentie not onely for themselues, but for their children. Yea so great was the prosperitie of wicked men, and so sharp his owne punishments and chastisements, that when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered of it, <hi>his feet were almost gone, and his steps had well</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm. 73. 2.</note>
                  <hi>neere slipt,</hi> being readie to preferre the estate of the vngodly, before the blessed condition of the children of God. And thus the Church in the Lamentations complaineth, <hi>that her aduersaries were the chiefe, and that her enemies prospered;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lamen. 1. 5.</note>
                  <hi>whereas she was afflicted, and her children led into captiuitie.</hi> But of this I haue spoken more fully when I generally intreated of prosperitie, and therefore will for the generall, adde no more testimonies nor examples.</p>
               <p>Onely let vs consider the truth hereof in those three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 7. That God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth honours as well vpon the wicked as vpon the godly.</hi>
                  </note> of honours, riches and pleasures. And first for honours wee shall find, that God hath more bountifully imparted them vnto the wicked and reprobate, then vnto
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:10731:168"/> the godly and faithfull. Thus <hi>Esau</hi> flourisheth in pompe and worldly glory, going attended in great state, with 400. men waiting at his heeles; and <hi>Iacob</hi> creepeth and croucheth vnto him, meanely accompanied with a few poore seruants, that tended his sheepe and cattell. Thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> sitteth in the regall throne, raigning and ruling at his pleasure, and making his corrupt and vniust will to stand for law; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> the beloued of the Lord, are humble suiters vnto him for the peoples libertie, and at his becke to go and come as he appointed. Thus the high Priests, Scribes and Pharisies, sit in <hi>Moses</hi> chaire, and are esteemed the great Rabbins and Doctors of the world; whilest the deare Disciples of Iesus Christ, are basely esteemed as Galileans and poore fishermen, conuented before the iudgement seats, checked, taunted, scorned and misused, as though they had bin the very offskourings of the world. Yea thus doe wicked <hi>Herod, Pilate, Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas</hi> raigne as Kings, and sit on the iudgement seate, absoluing and condemning whom they will: and contrariwise, our Sauiour Christ, the onelie begotten and dearely beloued Son of God, is haled before them, accused and reproched, scorned and derided, buffeted, spit vpon, whipped and misused.</p>
               <p>The like also may bee said of riches, with which wicked<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 8. Reprobates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as much as Gods seruants.</hi>
                  </note> men commonly most exceed; whereas Gods seruants often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are scanted of necessaries: So <hi>Nabal</hi> aboundeth in all superfluitie, and <hi>Dauid</hi> is an humble suiter vnto him for reliefe; the false Prophets are nourished at <hi>Iesabels</hi> table, and poore <hi>Elias</hi> is in commons with the Rauens; the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and Scribes eate the fat of the land, and abound in wealth, and the Disciples are forbidden to possesse gold or<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 9. 10.</note> siluer, yea, to carrie a scrip, wherein to put their needments, or to be owners of two coats at once; vnto <hi>Iudas</hi> is the bag committed, whereas <hi>Peter</hi> hath neither siluer nor gold, as he<note place="margin">Acts 3. 6.</note> professeth. The idolatrous Kings and heathen potentates haue the world at will, strouting themselues in their statelie palaces, and wallowing in their wealth; but Iesus Christ, the Lord of heauen and earth, and heire apparant of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Kingdome, when he is borne, hath a manger for his<note place="margin">Luke 2. 7.</note>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:10731:168"/> bed, the stable for his lodging chamber, and the oxen and horses for his chamber-fellowes. Neither was he better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for, when he came to riper age, for as himselfe testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>the foxes haue holes, and the birds of the heauen haue nests,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 17. 27.</note>
                  <hi>but the Sonne of man hath not whereon to lay his head;</hi> yea, so vnfurnished was he of wealth at some times, that when hee was to pay poll money, he was faine to borrow it of a sillie fish.</p>
               <p>Finally, the pleasures of the world are also Gods common<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 9. The wicked worldling hath a greater share of worldlie pleasures, then Gods deare children.</hi>
                  </note> gifts, which he bestoweth as well on the wicked and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, as vpon his owne children and seruants: yea in truth much more plentifully haue the enemies of God and his grace, enioyed them from the beginning of the world to this day, then those who haue feared and serued the Lord; for seeing they are to vs, by reason of our corruption, like kniues in the hands of children, and sweet and licorous meats, whereon they are apt to surfeit; therefore the Lord suffering wicked men, as it were slaues and vassals, to take their libertie, and to vse what diet they list, as not regarding their spirituall health and life, nor caring what becomes of them; hath alwaies had speciall care of his owne children, dieting them with such a small pittance, as they may well digest, without impairing the▪ health of their soules; and mixing these delicious drinkes of pleasures, in the bitter cup of afflictions, whereby he hath still purged away these grosse humours of corruption, when they began to abound with them through their daintie fare. And thus he suffered those abiects, <hi>Ismael</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> to spend their time in hunting and reuelling, pleasure and delight; whereas the promised seed, <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> to whom the promises belonged, spent their time in painefull labours, and whilest they kept their sheepe, indured the scorching heate of the Sunne by day, and the pinching cold of the frosts by night. Thus <hi>Dauids</hi> wicked enemies were so pampered with delights, <hi>that their eies</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm. 73. 7. 14.</note>
                  <hi>stood out with fatnesse, whereas he was daily punished and chaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned euery morning.</hi> Thus <hi>Diues</hi> the rich glutton, clothed himselfe <hi>with purple and fine linnen, and fared deliciously euerie</hi>

                  <hi>day,</hi> and poore <hi>Lazarus,</hi> beloued of God, is pinched with
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:10731:169"/> hunger, clothed with rags, and tormented with sores and sicknesses. Finally, the whore of Babylon is suffered to haue<note place="margin">Apoc: 17. 2. 4.</note> in her hand a golden cup, ful of voluptuous pleasures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and not only to drink thereof largely her selfe; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to make drunk with her abundance the great princes, and potentates of the earth: whereas the poore Saints of God haue allotted to their share the cup of afflictions, wherein our Sauiour Christ beginning to them, drunke a larger draught, then euer any mortall man. In which respect, the Lord dealeth with mankind, as the wise Physitian with his sicke patients; those ouer whom hee is most carefull, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard both of the loue he beareth them, and the hope he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth of their recouerie, he straightly dieteth, forbidding them the vse of those meats and drinkes, which by reason of their disease they loue and desire; and giueth them many a bitter potion, and troublesome plaister, that hee may hereby restore them to their health: whereas contrariwise those whom hee neglecteth, because their diseases are desperate, and past hope of cure, are permitted to vse what diet they list without restraint. And thus the Lord giueth to his deare seruants whom hee intendeth to cure, the bitter poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of afflictions, and restraineth them of worldly pleasures, which are so delightfull to their carnall appetites; whereas he suffereth reprobate men, who are desperately sicke in sin, to glut themselues with these fleshly delights, and to haue their owne carnall appetite, as the rule and direction of their diet.</p>
               <p>By all which it appeareth, that these worldly benefits<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 10. That the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monnesse of these earthlie gifts sheweth their vilitie and basenesse.</hi>
                  </note> of honours, riches and pleasures are common to the wicked, yea, that they haue in them the largest share, and greatest part; whereas contrariwise God bestoweth his spirituall graces, faith, loue, hope, a good conscience and the rest, as also the assurance of his eternall and heauenly ioies vpon his owne seruants and children, who are most neere and deare vnto him. Whereby it is cleare and euident, that these are infinitely of more worth and value then the other; for if we will acknowledge the Lord to bee a wise dispenser of his own gifts, we need not to doubt, but that he giueth his least
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:10731:169"/> benefits vnto those whom hee least affecteth, and reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his rich treasures, and choicest iewels, for those whom hee most dearelie loueth. Neither can it bee imagined,<note place="margin">

For what wise man will inrich his slaues, and suffer his deare children to liue in want? bee liberall to strangers and enemies, imparting vnto them gifts of great value; and denie the vse of them to his owne familie? whereby it manifestly appeareth, that seeing the Lord infinite in wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and in loue towards his seruants and children, as also in iustice towards his enemies, doth bestow these earthlie things more abundantly vpon the wicked, then vpon the godly; therefore hee esteemed them but small trifles of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worth or value, which hee bestoweth as temporall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vpon his slaues, and as wages for some base and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile duties by them performed; and that he accounteth his spirituall graces, and heauenly ioies his chiefe treasures, and gifts of greatest value, seeing he peculiarly reserueth them for his elect, and bestoweth them vpon his owne seruants and children, who are most deere vnto him.

And yet so strongly this ill grounded opinion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth with worldly and couetous men, that they take much more delight in beholding their siluer in their darke chests and closets, then the comfortable beames of the Sunne in a winters day, though it be the chiefe instrument of their life and being; yea are readie vpon all offers to sell the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God, that they may obtaine gold; and the ioyes of heauen together with their owne soules, that they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themselues with this shining earth and base mettall. The like also may be said of chaines, bracelets, rings, and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther massie ornaments; which were they not made precious and esteemable by the opinion of those that weare them, would otherwise bee thought combersome burthens, and troublesome clogs, which they would not be intreated, and scarcely hired to weare about them; yea were they imposed vpon them as a punishment, and not willingly put on as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, they would be borne with some impatiencie. But now so much are they extolled by the vaine opinion and conceit of men, that these things are not onely esteemed good, but in a high degree of excellencie, of which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come proud, as though they were parts of their owne bodie; insomuch as they carrie their deare prized fetters, and gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den giues, not only with ease, but also with pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and weare these burthens not onely vpon them, but pearce their eares and make holes and wounds in their owne flesh, that so they may hang these clogs about, yea fix them fast vnto thē. So as it is to be feared lest together with their opinion, their fondnes &amp; dotage increasing, they wil in time with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> barbarous Indians weare thē also in their lips &amp; noses.

Yea, they are delighted with their wounds, that they may thrust gold through their eares, and hang pearles and iewels at them: and yet these iewels haue their waight, and such clothing their cold; they sweat with the burthen of their iewels, and are chill with cold in their thin silkes; and yet the opinion of their price helpeth all; and that which nature abhorreth, couetousnesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth and extolleth.</hi>

                  </note> in that they are not commended vnto vs so much by their owne worth and excellencie, as by the competition of others who affect and seeke them as well as wee: for had we no corriuals in our loue to whet our affection, and shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen our appetite, it would soone faint and languish towards these earthly things, there being in themselues no substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all good which might serue as fuell to nourish and preserue it. But when as we see others admire and loue them, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to imagine that there is somewhat in them worth out liking and desiring, grounding this conceit not vpon our owne knowledge and exeperience, but vpon the iudgement and practise of those who haue gone before vs, or that liue
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:10731:174"/> with vs; who likewise haue beene after the same maner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and seduced, hauing had some such presidents which they also imitate. And when this conceit hath once posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vs, then selfeloue blowing the cole which phantasie hath kindled, our hearts are presently inflamed with a desire of obtaining that which so many seeke; partly to shew that our owne wisedome, policie and power, if we list to imploy them, can goe as fast a pace as other mens, and can with greater dexteritie and agilitie catch that game after which so many hunt; and partly because wee imagine, that there may be some worth and excellency in these things although we be ignorant of it, which if happily it should so fall out in the proofe and experience, we would rather at all aduentures enioy it then another, lest afterwards the worth appearing, we should haue cause to repent of our sloth and negligence, in that wee haue suffered others to outstrip and go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> before vs. And thus we affect these vanities not for any good or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie we see in them, but rather in selfeloue, pride, enuie▪ and emulation, because wee would preuent others, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that which they so much desire. Like vnto boyes, who with all eagernes runne after a ball, not for the loue of it self, but that they may catch it before another, whereas they would scarce looke after it, if they had no competitour to contend with them. And as the vulgar people running in flocks to see some vaine sight, do moue others which scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know wherefore they make such haste, to goe with them for companie, and euen to outstrip their fellows with nimble speed; so doe they runne with headlong haste in the pursuite of these worldly vanities; not because themselues know any worth or excellencie in them, but because they see that many haue gone before them, and that many are still going spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily in this course, they also goe for companie, labouring to preuent them with their haste, and to obtain that first, which being obtained they do not know as yet whether it be worth their hauing and enioying; yea and that which is worst of all, after that they see their errour, and hauing had triall of these things in their owne experience, doe plainly perceiue, that they deserue not their labour, nor are worthie of their
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:10731:175"/> loue; yet they will seeme highly to value and affect them still, lest the weakenes of their iudgements, which so much valued them before they had them, might bee discouered, and make account of them, now they haue them in their possession, lest they might seeme to haue spent all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and strength in vaine, which they haue taken and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the procuring of them. Like vnto a Merchant, who hauing trauelled farre and made an hard aduenture to fetch some stones, which report made him beleeue were precious and of great esteeme, after he hath brought them home doth highly value them still, although the cunning Lapidarie haue told him that they are but counterfeit, either that hee may put them off to others at his owne prizes, or at least may not impaire his credit, when as it should be knowne that hee hath lost all his charges, and receiued no fruite by all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: or like vnto those who hauing vainely spent much paines in the pursuite of some trifle, doe afterwards when they haue found their errour still magnifie and extoll it, not because they thinke it of any worth, but fearing lest they should be laughed to scorne for their follie and lost labour, they would by their praises incourage others to follow their example, that so they may be excused by the common error, and not be ridiculous seeing they haue so many fellowes.</p>
               <p>But let vs consider this in the generall instances of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. Honours haue a great part of their esteeme from competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so also riches, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</hi>
                  </note> riches, and pleasures. And first if we examine honours, we shall finde that they haue a great part of their worth and esteeme from competition, and the contending heate, and emulating desires, of those who affect and seeke after them. For what excellencie is in a long fetcht pedegree, sauing that men contend one with another who shall more enoble themselues by fetching it furthest, or in fame and vaineglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, sauing that they striue who shall be most famous and best esteemed of? or what priuiledge doth the vpper place bring with it, more then the lower, the right hand then the left, or the wall then the channell side, sauing that men emulating one another, doe striue and contend about them who shall haue preheminence? Finally, what worth and excellencie hath high preferment, which commonly is accompanied
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:10731:175"/> with most trouble and danger, sauing that men striue who shall ascend higher on this ladder, and in the heate of their contention tread their fellowes vnder feete, that they may rise before them? wherein what doe they else but behaue themselues like children, who goe together by the eares, whilest they contend one with another, who shall be king in their play? whereas within an houre after the play being done, they are all againe equall; or imagining a little hillock to be a strong fort, doe assault and defend it with as great skill and furie, as though the holding of it were a matter of great importance; whereas after the contention is ceased, it remaineth emptie, and is passed by with neglect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. And so these ambitious men hauing propounded these trifles as the cause of their emulation and contention, and being by reason of their pride and selfeloue, impatient of any foile, do with all earnestnes and eagernes striue about them, not because they thinke the things themselues for which they contend are worth their paines and labour, but because if they doe not obtaine the victorie, they thinke themselues much disgraced, in that they are not able to haue their will. The like also may be said of riches, the competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and earnest pursuite whereof by so many, addeth no small matter to the common opinion of their worth and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation: for otherwise wherefore doe men so greedily scrape much more then is sufficient for themselues, their charge, or any other good vse wherein they haue any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of imploying them, if they did not (measuring their goodnesse by their goods) desire to bee better then other men, and therefore couet to excell them in that which they thinke doth make them commendable, and more respected? Why doe they hoord them vp in great abundance, and like the dogge in the maunger neither vse them themselues, nor communicate them vnto any other for their vse and benefit; but that in a kinde of enuie and emulation they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all other in wealth, and bee accounted great by the large portion which they haue of these small vanities? In a word, why doe they so highly value that which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend neuer to vse; if it were not that they haue got them
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:10731:176"/> with great labour and difficultie; and by their wit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie haue outstripped many who were competitours with them in this golden suite? Whereas contrariwise if their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite were not sharpened by this corriualship, if in their ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernesse and emulation they did not thinke that they had lost all that, which they see others gaine; they would not so much esteeme and seeke after needlesse abundance and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie, but would rest contented with that which they did know how to vse. And thus also pleasures are made tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleasant and delightfull, and are then chiefly esteemed to be of some value, and worth the hauing, when as many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for them, some one among the rest, hath the inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; which if they did lie out in common, and might easily be inioyed without any emulation or competition, no man almost would looke after them, or thinke their fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on worth their cost and labour.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the worthlesse vanitie of these worldly things<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 7. Worldly things are commended vnto vs by the difficulties we find in obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them.</hi>
                  </note> hereby appeareth; in that they haue not so much estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from any excellencie that we find in them, when we haue them, as from the great difficultie, which we haue found in obtaining and comming by them, our labouring, suffering▪ hazards and dangers, endearing our affection, and increasing our loue; and making vs apt to proportion our estimation, not according to the worth of these vaine wares, but to our own venture and paines which we haue taken in compassing of them; because we would not be subiect to the censure of follie, for not making of a good bargaine. And hereof it is, that these things, though they be but of small worth, yet are they greatly esteemed, because they are purchased and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured with no small labour; for as nothing is more easilie contemned, then that which is easilie gotten, according to the common prouerbe: Lightly come, and lightly gone; so nothing maketh a thing more deare and pretious, how worthlesse soeuer it be in it selfe, then when it is bought at these deare rates, and compassed with much paines and great difficultie; It being the nature of man to haue delight of comming to his ends by the way of opposition, and to think it more glorious to inioy his desires by a doubtfull victorie,

               <p>And thus honours are highly valued and esteemed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not obtained without great labour and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as abroad by lying in the open fields, by watching in the night, and toiling in the day, by innumerable perils in open fight, and secret ambushments, wounds, skarres, effusion of blood, and continuall hazard of life; or else at home by the painefull and carefull seruice of the state, which is often ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with as much hazard as labour. By which difficult meanes when they are compassed, they are answerably estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and valued, not according to their owne worth, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these deare prizes, at which they were purchased. Or if the estimation of these honours bee not aduanced by these outward difficulties, (as in truth this dangerous way of comming vnto honour, was neuer in any age lesse trauelled)<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Audax omnia perpeti, gens hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana ruit per vetitum nesas.</hi> Horat.

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:10731:177"/> and place themselues in the feare of honour. The which is the more vsuall path which is tracted in these daies, men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now become so politike, that they will not take substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall paines, to bee rewarded with a shadow, but fitting their worke according to their wages, they compasse vaine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours with semblances of good and vaine shewes. But yet in the meane time by vsing these wicked and vnlawfull meanes to attaine vnto their desires, they hazard their salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for the purchasing of honours by vnlawfull means, they set their soules to sale; and therefore it is no maruell if hauing obtained them, they doe highly value them, seeing they haue bought them at such deere rates. And thus riches are most highly esteemed, when as they are most hardlie compassed; that onely being thought worth the hauing, which cannot be had without much paines and perill; and all other things being esteemed worthlesse and light▪ which haue not difficultie and danger put into the skole with them, to make them downe waight. This maketh pearles trulie precious, because they are farre fetched from the Easterne parts of the world, and not onely bought at deare rates, but also brought home with great danger. This maketh gold and siluer esteemable, because they are digged out of the Westerne mines with much sweate, and not procured but by great labour and trauell, hazard and danger, both by sea and land. This improueth riches farre aboue their worth, because they are obtained with much labour, care, and watching, by pinching and afflicting the body whilest they let it goe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten emptie, that they may more speedily fill their chests; and that which is worst of all, by hazarding the eternall salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their soules, in vsing wicked meanes, as lying, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, swearing, forswearing, oppression and all manner of crueltie, for the increasing of their wealth. All which diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in getting riches, make men the more to loue and esteeme them when they haue them: whereof it is, that hee who hath thus dearely purchased his wealth, doth alwaies much more affect and value it, then his heire who commeth lightly by it▪ euen as the mother doth much more account of a childe for which her selfe hath laboured, then of another

Yea and thus also our delights are made much more delightfull by those spirituall difficulties, the word of God forbidding, and the conscience condemning them: for as the Wise man saith, <hi>stollen waters are sweete, and hid bread is pleasant;</hi> or as he saith in another place, <hi>the bread which is gotten by deceit is sweete to a man.</hi> Neither is there any thing which more commendeth pleasure to a naturall and carnall<note place="margin">

Now what can more shew the worthlesnes of these worldly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then that they haue their chiefe estimation from those things which are shunned and abhorred, and haue almost all their sweetnes and delight, from other things bitter and loathsome? and as well-waters hauing no heate in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, are said to receiue some little warmth by antiperisthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis and the inclosure of some greater cold; so these vanities hauing little goodnesse, are made to seeme good, when as
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:10731:178"/> they are compassed and inclosed with loathed euils, euen as this miserable world it selfe would seeme a paradise to one that should newly come out of hell, not in regard of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse inioyed in the present estate, but of the vnhappinesse and miserie of his former condition out of which he is esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. And therefore seeing these things haue in them no selfe excellencie, but are onely commended vnto vs by troubles, difficulties, and dangers, let vs no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Lastly, the vanitie of worldly things hereby appeareth, in<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 10. Worldly things are esteemed more for their rarenesse then for their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Nulli gratum quod omnibus datum.</hi>
                  </note> that they are not so much esteemed and affected for their goodnesse, as for their rarenes; there being nothing in the world so excellent that is much respected if it grow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; nothing almost so meane and triuiall, which proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and raritie will not make excellent▪ For as a tall man is not regarded when the countrie inhabitants are almost all of an high stature; nor those flowers respected, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise beautifull, which grow wilde in euery field; so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are any worldly things held in price, when as they are embased by vulgar communitie. And this is the cause why Diamonds are esteemed and admired, and the Sunne negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and little obserued; because this is subiect to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon view, and free to all mens vse, that peculiar to some few only, and that of the richer sort: this maketh health to be but slightly regarded, sauing of those who want it, and wealth to bee magnified and extolled: this maketh countrie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to be basely valued at home, and to be much estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med abroad; and whereas the things themselues are of equal worth and vse, yet the raritie or commonnesse wonderfullie<note place="margin">Dignitas in plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res diffusa vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescit.</note> altereth the price and estimation. Thus honors and glorious titles if they should be made common vnto all, they would
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:10731:178"/> of all be lightly esteemed; whereas now being rarely and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiuely conferred, they are magnified as the chiefest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies. Thus riches haue their worth improued to that high account, because few can attaine vnto them; whereas if euery man abounded in wealth, then, as in the time of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> siluer would bee no more esteemed then stones, nor gold then siluer. So who would esteeme of costly attire, if all went in royall apparell? who would highly value precious stones, if euery one had them in possession? In a word, no ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches would bee accounted treasures, if they were no more commended by their rarenesse, then by their worth. And the like also may be said of pleasures, in which none would ioy, if all did inioy them; nor take any delight in them, if they were communicated to all, or to themselues continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and at all times; but being made daintie in respect of sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vse, and conferred but to some as choice priuiledges, this makes those who haue them to esteeme them, as much for pride because they are preferred before others, as for any delight they haue in their vse; and those who want them, to long after them, because they also would bee aduanced to these no common priuiledges. This were easie to shew in particulars. For who would take pleasure in great cheare, if all men had full tables, or themselues at all times? Who would delight in beautie or brauerie, if herein all did match them? or in sweete musicke, if they had no other sound in their eares but this melodious harmonie? In a word, there would no worldly thing be esteemed of any worth, if it were not for raritie and proprietie. To this purpose one of the Ancients saith, that <hi>all these earthly things, haue all their grace</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Haec omnia de raritate &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrinitate sola gratiam possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, &amp;c.</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tull. de habit. mulier. lib.</note>
                  <hi>and excellencie, from their rarenesse and strangenes, neither is there any thing almost much esteemed in it owne countrie, and all abundance in it selfe is neglected and despised. And hence it is that because among certaine barbarians, gold is homebred and abundant, their prisoners are fettered and inchained with gold; and loading malefactors with riches, they make them so much the more wealthie, by how much they are more guiltie and faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> Whereby it appeareth that these things are not truly and absolutely good vnto vs; for that which is good in this
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:10731:179"/> degree, would not be impaired, but multiplied and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by communitie, euen as the ioyes of heauen are infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly redoubled, in regard that there being innumerable Saints and Angels, which mutually communicate in one anothers ioyes, according to their number their ioyes also are redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and multiplied. And therefore let vs esteeme and set our hearts and affections vpon this heauenly happinesse, which the more common it is, the better it is, according to the nature of true goodnesse; and not vpon these earthly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, which because they doe not satisfie those that haue them, therefore they seeke contentment by multiplying and ingrossing them, thinking to finde that in all, which they cannot finde in any part, and affect proprietie in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they seeme vnto themselues to want, that which they see others enioy, and to be robbed of that, which their gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die eye beholdeth in anothers possession.</p>

                  </note> worldly things, both by testimonies, and manifest reasons. Let vs now more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly examine the vanitie of honours, riches, and pleasures: where wee shall plainly see, that as there is generally no worth or excellencie in these worldly things; so neither in any of these speciall parts and branches. And first for worldly honour, how base and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible it is, in comparison either of that true honour of a Christian, before described, or the eternall glorie of Gods kingdome, it will more easily appeare, if wee consider it in the chiefe parts thereof, and take a serious view of those things which in the world are accounted honourable. For this worldly honour consisteth in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame and vaine glorie, or popularitie and fauour of the common people; or prioritie of place and precedence, or the fauour of Princes, and great
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:10731:179"/> personages; or finally in high aduancement and preferment, to places and offices of greatest dignitie and royaltie; or in the concurrence of all, or some of these together: all which are vaine, and of no worth, or true excellencie, as we shall plainly perceiue, if we do take but a slight view of them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally. And first for fame and vaine-glory, which is nothing else but the applause of the multitude, whereby they magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and extoll a man out of their opinion of his worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, if we examine it, we shall find both that it is false and counterfeit, and also that it is vaine and vnprofitable: for it is not that true honor before described, consisting in a good name and estimation of the godly and vertuous, for true worth and desert; but the clamour of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, extolling those, whom in a sudden opinion they thinke worthie: which is not like that, referred to Gods glory and the spirituall good of the partie; but being arrogated to themselues as their own due, it wholly tendeth to puffe them vp with pride, and a fond opinion of selfe excellencie. And therefore seeing it is false and counterfeit, how glorious soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it appeares, it is not to be valued, but to be contemned as base and forged. For as when we see persons on the stage in<note place="margin">Chrysost. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. ad pop. 43. tom. 4.</note> glorious and royall apparell, and much more richly adorned, then such as are great Princes and potentates in truth, yet we do not reuerence or much respect them, because we know that they are but personated, and only great by apish imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: so how goodly a shew soeuer this vaine glorie maketh, yet seeing it is not the true glorie of a Christian, but a false and counterfeit shadow thereof, it is to be neglected and contemned.</p>
               <p>But as this fame and glorie of the world is false, so also<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. That worldly glorie is vaine and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
                  </note> vaine and vnprofitable; as it may appeare at the first sight, if if we do but consider of the name, which by common tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is giuen vnto it: for although all worldly things are full of vanitie, yet this glorie peculiarly hath this title of vaine prefixed vnto it, as challenging it vnto it selfe by a certaine<note place="margin">Fama ventus est, fumus est, vmbra est, nihil est.</note> kind of proprietie, or singular eminencie, as though howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all things are vaine, yet nothing in comparison of this vaine glorie. For what in truth is this false fame and glorie of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:10731:180"/> the world, but a smoake or vapour, which is tossed to and fro with the breath of euery ones mouth? What is it but a cloud or shadow, which whilest a man thinketh to catch and hold fast, it vanisheth away and commeth to nothing? And what do worldly men doting vpon this vanitie, and seeking to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, that they may commit spirituall whoredome with it, but <hi>Ixion</hi>-like in stead of their goddesse catch a cloud, on which they beget the monstrous Centaures of many missha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and vgly sinnes? What do they but like wanton and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish boyes run after a sopie bubble, raysed with the breath of their companions mouthes, because it seemeth beautifull through varietie of colours, although it commonly vanish in the pursuing, or at least breake as soone as it is but touched? And yet though this glorie be neuer so vaine, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite thereof most childish and ridiculous, notwithstanding the wise men of the world fall into this absurd dotage, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meleon-like gaping after this common aire, and feeding themselues fat onely with the conceit of this vulgar breath. And as they seeme to haue their life, or that which is the life of their life, all their ioy and comfort, from the breathing in of this ayre; so also it is the sterne which ruleth them in all their courses, turning them to and fro at the praysers plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: neither is there any meanes whereby a man may better carrie these earthly and brittle pitchers, then by holding them by the eares, and tying them fast vnto him by this gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den string of praise and commendations: for if they be extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and magnified, what desperate difficulties will they not vndertake? What dangerous enterprises will they not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt? What toilesome labour will they refuse to take? or what excessiue cost will they not bestow, that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue or encrease their fame and vaine glorie? Againe, if there bee no man that seeth them, or that seeing will commend them, how sluggish and slothfull are they in attempting any vertuous actions, where the least difficultie or danger doth appeare? Herein not vnfitly to be compared vnto ships, which saile merrily forward whilest they haue a good gale of wind, stand still when they are becalmed, and turne backe againe when the gust bloweth hard against them: so these go cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:10731:180"/> forward in vertuous courses, so long as the winde of vaine glory helpeth them forward, stand still and do nothing worth note, when as they are not praised and commended; and are vtterly discouraged and turne backe againe, when they are dispraised for well doing; being readie to embrace any wicked course which promiseth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But this is a signe of a base nature, so shamefully to beg glorie, the wages of vertue, from posteritie, after they are dead, which they neuer earned for any vertuous actions, which they did when they were aliue; to catch at the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of vertue, and neglect the bodie, which when they haue got they are neuer the richer; for who would not esteeme that as light as nothing, which is the reward of nothing, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently extorted without desert?</p>

And as this contempt of vaine glorie is in the Scriptures enioyned; so our Sauiour Christ and his holy Apostle do professe the practise thereof, for so Christ saith, that <hi>he sought not his owne praise:</hi> yea so far<note place="margin">Iohn 8. 50.</note> was our Sauiour from ambitious affecting and seeking this vaine glorie of the world, that hee would not accept of it when it was offered: <hi>I receiue not</hi> (saith he) <hi>the praise of men.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 5. 41.</note> And this also the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> professeth, that he sought for no praise neither from the Thessalonians, nor from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">1.

And what can be more vaine and void of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, then that which hath it subsistence and being in so vnstable a ground, as the vaine breath and mutable opinion of the common people?

And as their praises are vaine and of no worth, so also are they vaine and void of wisdome who do much affect them: for as their folly were ridiculous, who would haue blind men iudge of colours, and account that most excellent which in their doome and opinion is preferred; so is it no lesse absurde to make the vulgar people of the world iudges of vertue and good parts, who being blind and ignorant, iudge not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to truth, but according to their fond opinion; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

But howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Christians are much to account of the loue of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and rulers, when as hauing it, they may also retaine the loue and fauour of God, because they are his Deputies and Lieutenants vpon earth: yet when there is such opposition betweene them, that both will not stand together, (as it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies hapneth when either it cannot be gotten or kept but by sinfull and wicked meanes) then is this fauour of great Potentates to be lightly esteemed, yea to be contemned and reiected, that wee may retaine the fauour and loue of God; according to the example of the three children, who how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they were in chiefe fauour and estimation with <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezer,</hi> yet when they could not enioy it still, vnlesse they would offend God, by committing idolatrie, in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping his image; they set his fauour at nought, and regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not his displeasure and fierce wrath: as also in <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, who though hee were in good account with <hi>Herod,</hi>

                  </note> loathe this sweetnesse of worldly fauour, when the poyson of sinne is mixed with it, let vs consider that it is not onely vaine and vnprofitable, but also dangerous and hurtfull. The vanitie chiefly appeareth in the vnconstancie and mutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it, and that both in respect of the fauour it self, and the persons fauouring. For the former, who knoweth not, that it is vsuall in the Courts of great Princes, to bee one day in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and the next in heauie displeasure; now graced with the chiefe honours of a kingdome, and soone after disgraced and vtterly neglected? An example whereof we haue in <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who being the Kings chiefe fauourite, ruled all at his owne pleasure; and the next day following was hanged vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the gallowes which himselfe had made for <hi>Mordecay.</hi> The which alteration often hapneth, for a small cause, often vpon an apparance and surmize only; and not seldome vpon meere phantasie and will, that they may please themselues with varietie of new fauourites; for as they oftentimes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance them highly into their loue without any desert, vpon conceit and opinion only, so this varying, their loue also va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth, sometimes turning to a cold neglect, and sometimes into mortall hatred. In which respect Princes fauourites are fitly compared to counters vsed for computation and casting accounts; which being all in themselues of like value, haue, according as it pleaseth the accountant to place them, a farre differing estimate, some standing for thousands, some<note place="margin">Orontes Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thec. apud Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch. p. 297. B.</note> for hundreds, and some for vnites; yea and those which now haue the place of the greatest summe, doe by and by stand for the least, and those which were of least estimate, are soon after taken for the greatest number. And in the same regard Princes fauours are likened vnto a tender eye, which the least moate falling into, causeth to water, and sometimes is offended with a blast of winde: for so the smallest trifle of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten changeth their affection, and sometimes meere winde of words, the rumours and tales of backbiters and syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:10731:188"/> moue them to displeasure. Of this <hi>Dauid</hi> had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who being greatly in <hi>Sauls</hi> fauour, suddenly procured his hatred, for no other cause, but by his owne worth and good deserts, and the others iealousie and vniust suspition. And therefore hauing by his owne experience, come to the knowledge of this inconstancie and mutabilitie; he saith that it is <hi>better to trust in the Lord, then to haue confidence in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm. 118. 9. Iohn 13. 1.</note> because where he <hi>loueth, he loueth to the end:</hi> his loue and fauour being immutable and vnchangeable. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose also <hi>Ieremie</hi> saith, that <hi>the hope of the hils is but vaine, and</hi>

                  <hi>the multitude of the mountaines, but in the Lord our God is the health of Israel.</hi> But though it were granted that the fauour of Princes were immutable, yet there is no cause why wee should set our harts much vpō it, for as much as thēselues are mortall, and readie to leaue vs when we most beare our selues vpon them, and to faile vs when as we thinke their loue our chiefe strength. And this argument <hi>Dauid</hi> vseth to disswade<note place="margin">Psalm. 146. 3. 4.</note> vs from trusting in Princes, because their breath departeth, and they returning to their earth, all their thoughts perish; accounting him blessed who puts his whole confidence in the Lord, whose loue is vnchangeable and himselfe eternall, and not in the Kings and potentates of the earth, whose loue is mutable, and themselues mortall, and consequently their fauours are a vaine stay to rest vpon, seeing they die with them: neither let any man thinke, that their fauours receiued are annexed to the crowne, and will continue by succession, seeing there is nothing more common, then for the heire to hate them, whom his father or predecessour loued and estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; it being the nature of soueraigne power not to ioy much in others loue, but rather to delight themselues in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of their owne making.</p>
               <p>But as this fauour of worldly Princes is vaine, so also is it<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 13. That the fauors of Princes are vnprofitable.</hi>
                  </note> vnprofitable; neither bringing to those that haue it any great good, nor exempting and freeing them from any great euil: it doth not make them better or more vertuous; yea often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times much worse, and more vitious then those that want it, puffing them vp with pride, and causing them to be insolent in all their carriage and behauiour. It doth not free them
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:10731:189"/> from dangers, but rather exposes them vnto them, nor deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth them from any great euils, as from the wrath of God, sicknesses and diseases, death and condemnation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Psalmist willeth vs <hi>not to trust in Princes, nor in the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm. 146. 3.</note>
                  <hi>sonne of man, because there is no helpe in them:</hi> and yet their fauours were more to be valued and esteemed, if as they did not greatly helpe vs, so they did not much hurt vs: But the truth is, they lay vs open to many perils, and subiect vs to many euils. For to say nothing of those dangers of sinne, to which they hazard vs, by making vs to forget God and our selues, with all good duties which we owe to both: they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose vs also to many worldly perils, as to the hatred of all those who enuie our aduancement, and disdaine that we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they should be partakers of such extraordinarie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours; and to all their cunning and malicious plots, whereby they seeke to vndermine vs, and to worke our ruine: yea no smal dangers do we run into, in respect of these great poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, who do affect vs; because their loue is vnconstant, and seldome do they vary and change towards their great fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, but it is with their vtter ruine. In respect whereof, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with them, is as if one played with a tame Lion, whose greatest loue is ioyned with imminent danger; feeing if he be but a little angred, he hath alwaies power to pull them in pieces, which though he do not euery day put in execution, yet is he daily feared; and though they often scape his pawes, yet commonly at last they are payed home once for all. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the fauour of great potentates exposes their fauourites into many dangers, so doth it also commonly plunge them into innumerable euils, and first and especially by drawing them on to base flatterie to please their humours, and retaine their fauours; being readie alwaies to speake, not what is most profitable, but what is most plausible, not what they know is the truth, but what they thinke will be best accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.<note place="margin">Si in clientelam foelicis hominis potentis{que} perue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris, aut veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas aut amicitia perdenda est.</note> To which purpose one saith, that those who come into fauour with great personages, must make account to betray the truth, or to lose all friendship. Secondly, as they must for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the truth, so also their libertie, and become true vassals and slaues readie to further all their designes, and that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:10731:189"/> with the hazard of their goods and good name, yea (which is worst of all) of their soules, by being their instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in effecting and bringing to passe things vnlawfull and wicked. In which respect it is a hard thing to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of great potentates, and not to be vile and base to a mans selfe. Lastly, by setting our hearts vpon the fauour of Princes, we expose our selues to that fearefull curse, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced<note place="margin">Ierem. 17. 5.</note> against all those who trusting in man, and making flesh their arme, doe withdraw their hearts from the Lord. And therefore seeing so little good, and so great euill commeth of the fauour of great potentates, when we set our hearts too much vpon it: let vs learne to weane our affections from this worldly dotage, and contemning the fauour of the greatest Monarch, when it commeth in comparison with the loue of God; let vs first and chiefely labour to be assured of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of our heauenly King, as being most profitable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, bringing with it no hurt, yea turning all our euill<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> into good, and inriching vs with earthly peace and securitie in this life, and with eternall glorie and happinesse in the life to come.</p>

The other branch of worldly preferment, is aduancement to high places and dignities: as places of Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, Nobilitie, Empire and Soueraignetie. The excellencie of Magistracie chiefely consisteth in their great power and authoritie, which they haue and exercise in ruling and gouerning others, who are inferiour and subiect vnto them, the which is in it owne nature good: for as <hi>Iob</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 12. 13. 16.</note> saith, God is the fountaine of all power and wisdome: and the Apostle telleth vs, that <hi>there is no power but of God▪ and the</hi>

                  <hi>power it selfe is not euill, but he that abuseth his power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; it is not authoritie that is euill, but ambition: finally, thus farre forth the ordination of power is from God, that he is to be accounted the minister of God who doth vse his power well; and therefore it is not the fault of the office, but of the minister, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the ordinance of God displease but the action of him who doth ill administer it. The Emperour giueth honor, and hath his due praise; but if any abuse this honor conferred vpon him, it is not the fault of the Emperour, but of the inferiour Iudge. What shall we say then? it is good to vse power, and to desire honor: good I say, if it be lawfully conferred, and not ambitiously snatched.</hi> But yet as I said of the rest of worldly blessings, so of this, it is not good absolutely and immutably, but of an indifferent nature in respect of the vse, good to those that make good vse of it, euill to those who abuse it vnto euill.

We cannot with all our might and authoritie command one
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:10731:191"/> sanctifying grace, or furnish our heart with one vertue; yea commonly this worldly power rather opposeth against grace, keeping it from entring where it is not, and nipping, curbing, and suppressing it where any seedes thereof are sowen; whereas they who are weake and contemptible, being manured by Gods husbandmen, doe like gentle and light grounds, bring foorth fruitfull increase of vertue and goodnesse; whereas the other, like stiffe and strong clay, do choake and burie whatsoeuer good seeds of grace are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them. And as this is to be obserued in seuerall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, so also we may note a great difference in the same men in these different estates: for how many haue we seene, who before they haue had preferments, haue been humble, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, religious, and inriched with many graces and good parts, who being aduanced to dignitie and authoritie, are changed with their estate, becomming proud and insolent, disdainfull and contemptuous, irreligious and prophane, or at least cold and negligent in all good duties, the power of Gods word becomming vnpowerfull vnto them, and their zeale being cooled, when this winde of vain glorie hath but a little blowne vpon them? And this difference is obserued<note place="margin">

It cannot deliuer vs from the iust vengeance of God in the day of his visitation, the Lord hauing a thousand meanes to weaken vs in our greatest strength, and being able to make our owne power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie the instrument of our destruction: for if he do but blow vpon vs with the breath of his displeasure, our proud might shall serue but as an ouer great saile to ouerturne vs,<note place="margin">

Finally, after death we shall haue no priuiledge by our authoritie and greatnesse, when as we shall all appeare before the iudgement seat of God: for then both Magistrates<note place="margin">2.

In which accounts if they come short, they shall at that day haue little ioy of all their former authoritie &amp; greatnes; seing it will but increase their debts, and make them to find so much the lesse fauour, by how much they haue abused the greater mercie.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I shewed that authoritie and great power,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. That worldly authoritie is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with pride and tyrannie.</hi>

It followeth that I also shew that it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto vs, being thus abused, much euill, and that both in respect of sinne and punishment. It is the cause, being abused through our corruption, of many sins, but especially of those two hainous and mother sinnes, pride and iniustice. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aduanced vnto these high places, it is vsuall with them to forget by what power they were thus aduanced; and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:10731:193"/> their dependancie vpon God, they begin to wax proud of themselues, and thinking it too base to sustaine the place of Gods deputies, they aspire themselues vnto the supreame soueraignetie, and rebelliously affect diuine honors. So <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezer</hi> being by his greatnes puffed vp with pride, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate himselfe to be a man, and would needs haue his image worshipped by all his people; and this was vsuall among the Heathen Potentates, who ambitiously desired to be deified, and to haue their statues and images erected, vnto which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worship was to be imparted. And thus <hi>Vzziah,</hi> howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he was a Prince of the better sort, yet when hee grew<note place="margin">2.

And as it maketh men proud in respect of God; so in respect of men, most insolent, disdainfull and tyrannicall. It is true indeed, that those who vse their authoritie well, do<note place="margin">

Moral. lib. 26. cap. 19.</note> keepe an humble mind in an high estate, like the Sun, which the higher it is, the lesse it seemeth, and do not so much looke at their superioritie of state and order, as at the equalitie of their naturall condition; and considering that all by nature are equall, and that it is sinne which maketh this difference of superioritie and inferioritie betweene them, therfore they aduance their power to beare sway ouer their vices rather then ouer their persons, and whilest they remember that they punish sinne, they do not forget that it is punished in their brethren. Nether do they (as one saith) so much reioyce to<note place="margin">Greg. Moral. lib. 21. cap. 11.</note> rule ouer men, as that they may profit them by their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, knowing that the ancient Patriarks were not so much Kings ouer men, as Pastors ouer sheepe, and that when God said to <hi>Noah</hi> and his sonnes increase and multiplie, and fill the earth, adding that their feare and dread should be ouer the beasts, fowles and fishes, hee doth not say also that it should be ouer men, because mans terrour should be ouer beasts and not ouer men. Although indeed holy gouernours desire to be feared of their subiects; but it is when as they see that they do not feare God, that at least they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained from sinne by this feare of man, who do not stand in awe of Gods iudgements: and therefore they are not proud of this feare, in which they seeke not their owne glorie, but
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:10731:193"/> the iust cariage and demeanure of their subiects: neither do they desire to be feared of ill liuers as they are men, but as they behaue themselues like beasts ouer caried with sensuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and when there is no vice to punish, they do not reioyce in the excellencie of their power, but in the equalitie of their condition, and are so farre from desiring to be too much fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they refuse to be too much honored. But the most part through the corruption of our nature, are apt to abuse their power and authoritie vnto pride and tyrannie, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that they exceed all that are subiect vnto them, as much in vertue, as they do in titles, in worth and desert, as they do in dignitie and power; and measuring themselues not by the rule of Gods word, nor by the testimonie of their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, but according to the hyperbolicall, or rather lying praises and commendations of palpable flatterers; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing that they are such as these false glasses would seeme to make them, they wax proud of their greatnes, esteeming their inferiours as base and contemptible, and thinking that they are good for nothing but for their vse, and that like cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers they only serue to make vp the summe of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and therefore they rule them not according to law and equitie, but according to their will and pleasure, neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering what they ought to do, but what by their power they are able to do; nor think what is good for their inferiors but for themselues, as though it were their <hi>summum bonum</hi> and chiefe happinesse, if by their labours, wealth, lands and liues, they can procure vnto them the least pleasure or profit, or giue them the least ease of any trouble. So that it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of greatest difficultie to excell in authoritie, and to beate downe pride; to haue great power, and not to thinke it grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then it is; to rule ouer inferiours, and not to insult ouer<note place="margin">Ecclesiasticus 3. 19. §. <hi>Sect. 7.

For as for them, they are not masters of any thing which they enioy, all their goods and substance being daily endangered to their spoyle and rapine; the which their iniuries they must indure not only with silence and patience, but at least with outward cheerefulnes and thankfulnes: for if they seeme but to take notice that they are wronged, they doe make way for a new mischiefe, and put them in minde to redouble the iniurie.

Whereby it commeth to passe, that howsoeuer they are sometime safe, yet they are neuer secure, but spend their life in continuall agonies and perplexities.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd thus much concerning the vanitie of<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 1. What nobilitie is, and the signes thereof.</hi>
                  </note> worldly power and authoritie. The second kind of preferment or aduācement is world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nobilitie, which we will first distinguish from that nobilitie which being good and lawfull, is to bee approued and respected; and afterwards shew the vanitie of that, which being worldly and wicked, is to be despised and contemned. And first we are to know that nobilitie generally considered, is nothing else, but that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable greatnes, fame and reputation, which men haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued vnto them from their progenitors, both by reason of their famous vertues, and notable deserts, and also their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement to places of dignitie and greatnes of estate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vpon them for their worth by their Prince and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: the which together with their fame and great esteeme, is deriued successiuely from them to their posteritie. The signes of which nobilitie are diuers, as a memorable descent, and famous genealogie, deriued a far off from their first wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deseruing and aduanced ancestor, or first founder of their house, vnto their next parent; honorable titles, wherewith the race from time to time hath been enobled, armes and coates granted vnto them, for their worth and seruice of state, as a perpetuall remembrance of their wel-deseruing: vnto which we may adde those statues and images, which in ancient times were vsed to continue a glorious memorie of their progenitors.</p>
               <p>The which order of nobilitie is good and warrantable, as<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. That nobilitie in it selfe is good and lawfull. Iura regalia.</hi>
                  </note> may appeare by these reasons. First, because in the first wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered common-wealth, the kingdome of Israel, euen whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest the Lord himselfe did hold in his owne hand the right of royaltie, gouerning them by his owne law, and ruling ouer them as their chiefe Soueraigne; this superioritie of nobility was established, there being set ouer euery tribe their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:10731:197"/> and Peeres, who were both in fame and state chiefe of all the rest: as also in that he did appropriate both the soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ouer the common-wealth, and chiefe superioritie in the<note place="margin">Genes. 49. 10.</note> Church, vnto certaine tribes and posterities, who being thus enobled by God, did hold this honor peculiarly to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, vnto the time of Christ. Secondly, this difference of<note place="margin">Num. 3. 1.</note> order, that there should be some noble, and some inferiour and common people, hath his ground both from ciuill poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, for the wel-gouerning of the common-wealth, which could not well stand, vnlesse these potent Peeres, as it were chiefe pillars, did vphold it; and also from nature it selfe, for the Lord hauing bestowed some heroicall gifts and graces vpon some speciall men, as wisdome, magnanimitie, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, magnificence, courtesie, liberalitie and the rest; doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for the good of common-wealthes vsually vouchsafe, that<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Generosa in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus semina ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surgunt suos.</hi> Senec. in Troade.</note> there should be certaine seeds of these vertues deriued after a secret and vnknowne manner, from them successiuely vnto their posteritie, whereby being come to maturitie, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble their ancestors in these speciall graces: and howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer God sometimes altereth this order and course of nature, either to punish some speciall sins of that familie, or to shew his owne absolute omnipotencie, which cannot be subiected to nature, or inferiour causes, suffering some to degenerate from their ancestors, and to lose these heroicall gifts; as also conferreth them vpon some other of meane qualitie, whom it is his pleasure to aduance, yet most vsually he holdeth the former course; and though one of this noble posteritie doe degenerate, yet commonly the seeds of these vertues, which haue lien hid in him, and as it were buried vnder the earthie burthen of his corruption, are deriued from him to his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring, and being as it were againe quickened and reuiued shew themselues: euen as a father being by some accident maimed of an arme or leg, doth neuerthelesse beget perfect and well formed children, because generation is not tied to one <hi>indiuiduum</hi> or singuler person, but to the whole kind and ordinarie course of nature. And this proprietie of gifts which are of speciall eminencie, we may obserue in other creatures, as in plants, trees, birds and beasts; that as they are
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:10731:197"/> bestowed vpon some of them, so they are continued to their whole kind and race, vnlesse some by accident do degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: as for example, thus cions and yong grafts resemble the tree from which they were cut, admitting no alteration, though they be grafted into a new stocke; and thus horses take after their race, dogs after their kind, and hawkes and and other fowles participate the nature and properties of that straine whereof they are bred. Lastly, nobilitie serueth for good vse, as it is a meanes both to restraine from vice, or at least from open and notorious crimes, and to prouoke men to good and vertuous actions; for being hereby as lights set vpon an hill, vpon which the eies of all men are fixed and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened, they are restrained from many open and grosse sins, for feare of dishonoring themselues and blemishing their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and incited to many vertues and ciuil actions, for the maintaining of their credit and estimation: which ends, though they be not religiously good in themselues, when as they are only, or chiefly propounded, yet are they the cause and occasion of good both to the Church and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth▪ By all which it appeareth, that nobilitie is to be much esteemed of all, and to be reuerenced and respected of inferiours; and therefore those speeches of Heathen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and also of many Christian writers, which tend to the bringing in a paritie amongst the faithfull, and an absolute contempt of nobility, are either themselues to be contemned and reiected, or els to be applied to that false and counterfeit nobilitie, which consisteth only in outward titles, and in the worth of ancestors, being in it selfe worthlesse and destitute of all vertue and goodnesse.</p>
               <p>Which error that we also may not fall into, in shewing the<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. That true nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is much to be honored and respected.</hi>
                  </note> vanitie of nobilitie, we must distinguish it into two kinds: the first we may tearme true and compleate nobilitie, when as men doe ioyne with that honor, which they haue from their ancestors, their owne vertues and good deserts, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally religion and true godlinesse; that so they may be noble, not only by inheritance, but as it were by their owne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, and appeare no lesse good in the sight of God, then glorious in the eyes of men. And this is than true nobilitie,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:10731:198"/> which wheresoeuer it is found, is to be reuerenced and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected with double honor, both for the greatnesse which they haue from their ancestors, and for the goodnesse which is in themselues; yea and so much more for this then for the other, as goodnesse excelleth greatnes, in the iudgement of all who are seasoned with true wisdome. Neither is this true<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Minimè deus est acceptor perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum; nescio tamen quo pacto virtus in nobili plus placet: an forte quia plus claret?</hi> &amp;c. Bernard. ad Sophiam vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem.</note> nobilitie much respected and valued amongst all good men only, but it is also most acceptable vnto God; for howsoeuer the Lord is no respecter of persons, but regardeth vertue in the begger, as well as in the King; yet he more respecteth and rewardeth the vertues and good parts which he findeth in true nobilitie, then in the common sort; partly because they more glorifie him, and do more good to his Church, being more exemplarie, drawing on their inferiours to their imitation; and partly because they haue stronger tentations to draw them aside out of their course of goodnes: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they continue in the right way, and after a more dangerous conflict, obtaine a more glorious victorie then priuate men, it is no maruaile if they haue a greater reward, and richer crowne allotted vnto them.</p>
               <p>The other kind of nobility is worldly and imperfect, when<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. That worldly nobilitie is of no worth or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie.</hi>
                  </note> as men are enobled only for the vertues and deserts of their ancestors, hauing no worth or good parts in themselues, wherein they do in any degree resemble their predecessors; but retaining only their name, titles, armes and honors, do wholly degenerate from them in their vertues and good qualities. The which nobilitie, howsoeuer▪ it maketh a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious shew in the world, yet is it in truth base and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, as being no true nobilitie, but a bastardly and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ofspring, or but as a dead truncke, which retaineth some outward forme or shape, but wanteth vertue and goodnesse which is the soule thereof, whereby it should haue it chiefe essence and being, without which it soone rotteth and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth. And this is that worldly, maimed, and lame nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which is to be neglected and contemned: first, because it is of no worth or excellencie vnto any, being seuered from true vertue and godlinesse, in that they haue lost the chiefe and formall difference, whereby they were first aduanced
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:10731:198"/> aboue the common sort, namely those heroicall vertues, and good parts, which first enobled their ancestors. Neither is it birth and succession alone that can make noble, for as the Heathen man well obserued, there is no King, who hath not<note place="margin">Plato.</note> descended of seruants; no seruant, which hath not had a King for his predecessor, long time hauing made a mixture of all estates, raising some from the dunghill, to the throne; and deposing others from great honours, to the lowest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and most abiect disgrace. Againe, if wee respect our common matter, we are all made of the same earth and clay, and readie when God taketh away from vs the breath of life, to become al alike, and to turne into the same principles whereof we were made. If we looke vnto our pedegree, we haue the same <hi>Adam,</hi> the same <hi>Noah,</hi> for our common ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, neither did the Lord make one man of more precious matter, to bee the roote and first progenitour of the noble, and another of baser mould, to bee the first beginner of the poore and contemptible; but one and the same <hi>Adam</hi> to be the father of all. Finally, if we respect the soule, our more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent part, may we not also say with the Prophet, <hi>Haue wee</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Malach.▪ 2. 10.</note>
                  <hi>not all one father? hath not one God made vs?</hi> and hath not the same Creator breathed into vs the same breath of life? In all which respects there is no superioritie, but wee are all alike the creatures of God, and brethren one to another. And as there is no difference betweene diuers peeces of the same lumpe of clay, although the one bee contained in a golden, the other in a earthen dish; nor betweene two peeces of wood, of the same tree, because the one is couered with rags, and the other with cloath of gold; so there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of excellencie, betweene the noble and ignoble, the King and the meanest subiect, if they bee considered in this generalitie of nature, though there bee no comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them in their worldly estate. Wherein then doth the excellencie and superioritie of the noble consist, aboue those who are of meane birth? Surely chiefly in this, that the Lord hath giuen vnto them the priuiledge of certaine heroicall vertues, excellent parts, and good deserts, whereby they are aduanced to honour and places of dignitie▪ And
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:10731:199"/> therefore those Nobles who are destitute of these vertues and good parts, and defiled and imbaced with all manner of sinne and vice, haue in them no sparke of true nobilitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing depriued and destitute of this formall difference; nor yet any right of superiority ouer their brethren from nature, but only haue an hereditarie shadow thereof, and that only by vertue of tyrannicall custome, or at least ciuill and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike order.</p>
               <p>Let no man therefore boast himselfe of his farre fetcht pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degree,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 5. That there is no cause why any should glorie in worldly nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi>
                  </note> vnlesse he can proue also a succession of vertues and good parts. For the further he deriueth it, the neerer he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to <hi>Adam,</hi> in whom there is not so much cause of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying for his aduancement, as of shaming for his sinne and downfall. And if hee that ascendeth thus farre, would rise one degree higher, hee should finde his next ancestor to be the dust and clay, in which there would bee more reason of humiliation, then of pride in the next descent, seeing he may iustly say with Iob <hi>to corruption, thou art my father, and to the</hi>

                  </gap> glorie in the shadow of honourable titles, being abandoned of the substance of their inward vertues, and their outward well deseruing; let not their varietie of armes, and rich coates puffe them vp, seeing these were gotten by others, and should if they had their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts be lost by them, it being a matter of great equity, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> vice should lose, that which vertue hath wonne. Finally, let them<note place="margin">

               <p>Againe, the worthlesnes of this worldly nobilitie hereby<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. That God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth not worldly nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</hi>
                  </note> appeareth, in that God infinite in all wisedome, and true
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:10731:199"/> iudgement, esteemeth and respecteth it not: for as a gift of small value hee imparteth it as well to his enemies as to his friends; and aduanceth to this vaine nobilitie, the idolatrous Pagan, prophane Christian, and wicked worldling, as well, yea more commonly, then his owne children and seruants. So when himselfe was to make choice of men whom hee would aduance to sit vpon the royall throne, and to rule his people Israel, he neglecteth the great nobles of the land, and chuseth <hi>Saul,</hi> who was seeking his asses; and he afterwards being reprobated for his wickednesse, for the next succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he taketh <hi>Dauid</hi> from following of his sheepe. And this tenour he also obserueth in chusing such as he purposeth to adunace to bee first true members of the kingdome of grace, and afterwards to raigne with him in his kingdome of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: for as the Apostle witnesseth, <hi>not many mightie, not many noble are called, but he chuseth the weake things of the world to</hi>

For what will it auaile them to haue ruffled it out in worldly pompe for a short and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentanie life, and to bee eternally reprobated of God, and excluded from the vnspeakable ioyes of his kingdome; yea also to suffer for euer with the prince of darknesse, the intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable torments of hell fire?</p>
               <p>Thus also our Sauiour Christ the onely sonne of our su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 7. That Christ neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected worldly nobilitie.</hi>
                  </note> Soueraigne, and heire apparant to the kingdome of heauen, neglected and contemned this worldlie nobilitie, both in himselfe and others. For howsoeuer he was descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of most ancient and royal progenitours, and might haue assumed a glorious stile, and most honourable titles; yet he
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:10731:200"/> regardeth them not, nor any whit standeth vpon these worldly priuiledges, but vsually called himselfe the sonne of man. And howsoeuer being both God and man, hee might haue chosen for his next parent, some great Princes, equall or superiour in dignitie to any of his ancestors, yet he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to bee borne of a simple virgin, the espoused wife of a poore carpenter. Neither did hee regard this nobilitie any more in others, for being to chuse Apostles and Disciples to attend his person, and to be (as it were) the chief courtiers of this heauenly King, hee passeth by the nobles of the world, and maketh choice of sillie fisher men, and poore artificers. Finally, as the Lord himselfe thus meanely accounteth of worldly nobilitie, so also hath hee taught vs to value and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme it: for howsoeuer he would haue vs in our outward cariage, to obserue ciuill order, yet he maketh it a note of an heauenly inhabitant, to contemne a wicked man, how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious<note place="margin">Psal. 15. 4.</note> soeuer hee be in the world, and to honour those that feare the Lord. Where by the antithesis and opposition hee plainly sheweth, that he who feareth not God, is to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a vile person, though he haue neuer so many honorable titles; as the holie Ghost also stileth <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 11. 21.</note> howsoeuer the honour of a worldly Monarchie was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him.

               <p>But as there is no excellencie in this worldly nobilitie; so<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 8. That worldly nobilitie is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentanie and mutable.</hi>
                  </note> though there were, yet it deserueth no great esteeme, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that it is so momentanie, and also mutable: for say it should continue with them as long as they liue, yet what were this to be esteemed, seeing life it selfe being but a bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or vapour, is ready euery day to vanish away? yea though their name should outliue them, and their glorious fame should continue after them, euen to the end of the world, yet what is this in comparison of eternitie? But alas it is not so; for the iust iudgement of God beating down their pride, doth cause the name of wicked nobilitie to rot sooner then<note place="margin">Prou. 10. 7.</note>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:10731:200"/> their bodies, leauing no remembrance behind them, vnlesse it be of their sin and shame: yea this worldly nobility is not only momentany, but also mutable, and altogether vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to continue vnto this short period of life, seeing for their ill deseruing they outliue their nobility, &amp; their crimes like deadly poisons tainting their blood, do vtterly imbase their honor and reputation. In regard of which mutabilitie, the ancient nobility of Rome were accustomed to weare moones vpon their shooes, that being lift vp with their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and greatnes of state, they might haue this swelling as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaged,<note place="margin">Plutarch. de quaest. Rom. quaest. 76.</note> by hauing continually before their eyes this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of mutability.

Who would not thinke his folly ridiculous, who being himselfe lame, should be proud because he is descended from able and actiue parents? or being himselfe blind, should boast of his progenitors quicke eye-sight? or being dumbe, should bragge of their eloquence: or finally being a starke foole, should glorie and vaunt himselfe in his ancestors wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? And surely it is no lesse absurde for any, to beare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues high in the vertue and worth of their predecessours, when there is nothing in them but vice and worthlesnesse;
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:10731:201"/> there being farre greater cause why their progenitors should be ashamed of such a degenerate ofspring, then why they should be proud of such ancestors, whom they do not at all resemble in their vertues and good parts. It is true indeed that a yong colt is much esteemed for his race, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried whelpe for his kind he commeth of: but if being come to proofe, there be no courage or mettle in the one, nor any swiftnes or sagacity in the other; notwithstanding their race and kind, we esteeme no better of themselues, but as jades and curs; because it is not the goodnes of their kind which will helpe them in the race, or cause them to win the game, if they be vtterly void of selfe-excellencie. And so in like maner, howsoeuer greatnes of birth may commend yong no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, as giuing some hope in course of nature, that they will resemble the worth and vertues of their progenitours: yet when being come to riper age, they plainly discouer that they are vtterly degenerate, ful of base qualities, ignoble and vicious: they (notwithstanding the worth of their ancestors) are to be esteemed seruile and contemptible. For as paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage doth not absolutely conferre vertue, so neither nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; and as vertue it selfe is not hereditarie; so neither is nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, which (as I haue said) is chiefly grounded vpon vertue and goodnes. We see by experience, that from the same oare commeth base drosse and pure gold, from the same roote, a sharpe prickle and a sweet rose, and from the same graine of corne, both straw and chaffe, and also pure wheate: And it is often to be seene that the same vertuous parents haue both good and bad children descended of them: so faithfull <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> had an <hi>Ismael,</hi> as well as an <hi>Isaac;</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> as well a prophane <hi>Esau,</hi> as a vertuous <hi>Iacob:</hi> good <hi>Samuel</hi> had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ofspring: and holy <hi>Dauid</hi> had as well an <hi>Absolon</hi> and <hi>Adoniah,</hi> as a <hi>Salomon,</hi> and a <hi>Nathan:</hi> whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth<note place="margin">Virtus non est haereditaria.</note> that vertues cannot be entailed like lands, or though such an entaile were made, yet it proueth no perpetuitie, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is easily cut off, when as they degenerate from their ancestors, and hold a contrarie course in all manner of vice and wickednesse.</p>
               <p>But let vs consider the vnprofitablenes of worldly nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 11.

                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:10731:202"/> in some particular examples. <hi>Cain,</hi> as we know, was the first borne of <hi>Adam,</hi> who had his descent from God himself, and was heire apparant to the whole world, but what did it auaile him to haue the most excellent man for his father, and the soueraigne King of heauen and earth, in some sort, for his grand-father? Or what did his great birth-right profit him, when as defiling his heart with rage and crueltie, and his hands with innocent blood, he made himselfe to become a base vagabond vpon the earth? What did it benefit <hi>Cham</hi> to be noblie descended of that great and righteous Patriarch <hi>Noah,</hi> the second maine roote of repaired mankind, when as by his wickednes he became subiect to the curse, and being free-borne, did by his vice and sin make himselfe an abiect seruāt? What did it profit <hi>Ismael</hi> to be the first borne of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>Esau</hi> to be the eldest sonne of religious <hi>Isaac,</hi> whē as the one becōming a derider of Gods promises, was as it were excommunicate and cast out of that family, to which the couenant of grace was made &amp; appropriated; and the other shewing himselfe a prophane contemner of holy and heauēly things, lost both the birth-right &amp; the blessing? It were infinit to stand vpon such particulars; and therefore for breuitie sake, contenting our selues with these few, let vs also consider the truth hereof in a whole people or countrie. What nation in the world was euer comparable in nobilitie to the people of the Iewes? who being descended from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> the Father of the faithfull, had the Lord himselfe for the first and immediate founder of their common-wealth, yea for their King and Soueraigne, who iudged, ruled and gouerned them, as it were by his owne mouth in difficult causes, holding in his owne hand the royall lawes and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues, till they vnthankefully desired another King, and would needs be ruled like other nations. Againe, that which other people counterfeited, they truly had; namely, the Lord himselfe for their Law-giuer, who proclaimed the chiefe summe of their lawes by his own glorious voice, and at large expounded them by his faithfull seruant <hi>Moses;</hi> all which were much more excellent then the lawes of any other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Moreouer, if we respect antiquitie, they were most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:10731:202"/> there being no histories that make mention of any common-wealth, which was constituted long after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Israel: for whereas all writings and records were meerely fabulous among the Heathens before the wars of Troy; the learned haue found that this warre was long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the setling of the state of Israel, when as they had <hi>Iephthe</hi> for their Iudge. Finally, there was neuer any nation, who could so plainly and distinctly shew the antiquitie of their houses and kinred, by reason of that exact diuision of their tribes, families and inheritances, which was religiously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued among them. But yet what did all this nobilitie of the people of Israel auaile them, when as degenerating from their ancestors, they lost their vertues, the true life and soule of their nobility, and became vicious and polluted with all manner of sinne? Surely nothing at all; for do not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of God notwithstansting all this (looking vnto what they were, and not respecting from whom they were descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)<note place="margin">Esai. 1. 4. 10.</note> call them the seed of the wicked, corrupt children, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Gomorrah? Do they not tell them, that the cursed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanites were their kinted, their father an Amorite, and their<note place="margin">Ezech. 16. 3.</note> mother an Hittite? Yea doth not <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist go further, calling them a generation of vipers, and charging them no more to challenge <hi>Abraham</hi> for their father, seeing they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing resembled him in his faith and other vertues? And doth<note place="margin">Matth. 3. 7. 9.</note> not our Sauiour himselfe disgrace them with the same title? and when they gloried in their nobility, because they were<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 34.</note>
                  <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, doth not he tell them, that if they were the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they would do the workes of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 8. 44.</note> and plainly affirmeth that they were the children of the diuell, because they did his will, and resembled him in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their wicked lusts? So small account haue Christ and his Prophets made of this worldly nobility, being seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from vertue and polluted with vice and wickednes. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it any maruell if that nobility which is deriued from earthly parents, doth nought profit those who do not imitate their vertue, when as kinred and consanguinity with Christ Iesus himselfe, who was not only man, but also the glorious Sonne of God, did not at all auaile those, who were not as
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:10731:203"/> neere vnto him in faith, as they were in blood: for when it was told him that his mother and brethren did wait to speak with him, lightly accounting of earthly kinred, he far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth before it that kinred which was spirituall, affirming<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 49. 50. <hi>Nulla praeroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiua in successio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne est nisi fidei adstipul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And how little he esteemed of those who were his brethren in the flesh, and did not adhere vnto him by a liuely faith, it may plainly appeare in the seuenth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> by that disagreeing dialogue that was betweene them. So when a woman admiring his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine cried out, that the wombe was blessed that bare him, and the paps that gaue him sucke, he correcteth her speech, saying, <hi>yea rather blessed are they that heare the word of God</hi>

                  <hi>and keepe it.</hi> And therefore if this consanguinitie with Christ Iesus himselfe be vnprofitable, vnlesse through faith we be of spirituall kinred with him, how little will it auaile vs to claime the most noble on earth for our ancestors and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, if we be degenerate from them in vertue, grace and goodnesse?</p>

For thinking
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:10731:203"/> it vnfit for their nobility and greatnes, to adioyne themselues with the vulgar people, and that they should imbase their honor too much by comming into the publike congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they content themselues with their Chaplaine, as <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> with his Leuite, and not induring the publike Ministrie, where sinne is reproued without respect of persons, and the conscience searched to the bottome; they commit themselues ouer to his cure, who hauing his present meanes and future hopes wholly depending vpon them, dare not say any thing that may incurre their displeasure; nor yet apply any salues to their festred sores, which might cure thē to the bottome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would too much vex and trouble their delicate and wanton patients; but only such healing salues as draw ouer the sore a faire skinne of carnall security, but leaue the core behind, &amp; neuer free them from the inward putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this (I doubt not to say) is one chiefe and speciall cause of the irreligion and prophanenes of the nobility of these times, because they neglect the ordinance of God in the publike Ministery of the Word, which is the ordinary meanes of conuersion and saluation, and either do not at all performe this outward seruice vnto God, or else after their owne fashion, without power or profit, making himselfe of their charge, vnto whose charge they commit themselues; their seruant, before they make him their shepheard, and to depend vpon them for his bodily nourishment and meanes of life, before they will depend vpon him for their spirituall nourishment &amp; the food of their soules, which they wil haue cooked after their owne fashion, and fitted to their dainty pallet with their owne pleasing sauce, or else he is sure to lose their fauour, and with it the fruit of all his labours, and all the hopes of his tedious seruice, and base dependancie.</p>

Whereas contrariwise, they who are most noble in their worldly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, are notwithstanding all their honours and high titles, of a most abiect and base condition, as long as they remaine in the slauerie and bondage of sin and Satan; for what more vile seruitude can be imagined, then to be the seruant of sin, and to remaine Satans drudges, ready to doe his will? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, this spirituall and true nobility freeth vs from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerruling power of our corrupt affections, and from the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous tyrannie of our violent passions, bringing them vnder the rule of the law of God, and in subiection to holy reason. The which priuiledge worldly nobility wanteth; and consequently bringeth with it small grace or profit: for what auaileth it a man to bee outwardly glorious in the world, and inwardly base in himselfe? to haue other men to cap and crouch to him, when as he serueth more vitious and base masters then the worst that serue him? and whilest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers stoupe vnto him, and doe him honour; hee disgraceth himselfe by stouping and yeelding to his vile affections and violent passions? Finally, this true and christian nobilitie, doth cause vs to stand boldly in the presence of our great king, in assurance of his loue, and to offer vnto him our wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:10731:205"/> seruice, not for seruile feare, either of his heauie curse pronounced in his law, or of his feareful punishmēts denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against sin, either respecting this life or the life to come; but out of a free and generous disposition, because wee loue him, who hath loued vs first, and thinke nothing too much which we can do for his glory, who hath not thought the life of his dearest son, too deare for vs, but hath freely giuen it for our redemption and saluation; wheras worldly nobility hath no such priuiledge, seeing it neither conferreth vnto vs the confidence of sons, nor freeth vs from the slauish feare of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. For notwithstanding all this worldly glory, men may quake with feare, when God sheweth the least sign of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull presence, and either vtterly neglect the duties of his seruice, or performe them securely with carelesse neglect, or with great terror and trouble of mind.<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 15.

And therefore I will adde onely some things which may

Where first wee are to know that the following dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is not intended to shew the vanity, or perswade the contempt of cruell and barbarous tyrannie, which being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to God and men, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

The contempt whereof as it ought not to be absolute in any but onely in respect of abuse: for it is a thing of as great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme as any else in the world, when as a good king ruleth well, and not according to his owne lusts and vnlimited plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but according to the law of God, the law of nations, and the particular lawes of his owne kingdome: so ought it not to be in all, but in those onely who are either possessed, or in possibility of this supreame soueraignetie; vnlesse it be as we vnderstand it comparatiuely in respect either of spirituall graces, or heauenly ioyes. For as for those who are in subiection, they are to honour and esteeme their soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes in the next place to God himselfe: seeing this rule and authoritie is Gods ordinance, and kings are his deputies<note place="margin">Psal. 82. 1. 6.</note> and lieuetenants, and as it were the great stewards of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, whom hee hath dignified by giuing them his owne name and titles, and hath bound vs by his word to owe and yeeld vnto them all honour, loue and dutie. So the Apostle saith, <hi>Let euery soule be subiect to the higher powers, for there is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1. 2. 1: Pet. 2. 13.</note>

For look what the shepheard is to the sheep, the pilote to the ship, the captaine to the souldier, yea the head and heart to the body; and such is the king to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>

                  </note> transcendent power is to bee duely valued and esteemed of those, who are by Gods prouidence aduanced to this roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie;
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:10731:206"/> seeing it is a great gift and royall prerogatiue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Lord hath inriched them aboue all their brethren, requiring a proportionable thankfulnes, which they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yeeld, vnlesse they know and esteeme the benefit: yea it is not only a gift, but a blessing, expressed in that maine bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, wherewith God blessed <hi>Abraham,</hi> the great Patriarch and Father of the faithfull: <hi>I will make thee</hi> (saith he) <hi>excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>

Neuerthelesse howsoeuer kingdomes are the chiefest of worldly preferments; yet are they not to take vp the chiefest place in our iudgements and affections, seeing they are but of meane worth, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Gods spirituall graces, or the eternall ioyes of his kingdome. In respect whereof they are to be meanely valued<note place="margin">Nec abnuendum est, si dat impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium Deus, nec adpetendum.</note> and moderately desired; that is, neither to be refused when God giueth them, nor to be affected when as he denieth them, not giuing vnto vs lawfull means of attaining to them: yea they are directly to be contemned and reiected, when as they come in competition for our loue with those other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, as being in comparison of them worthlesse and<note place="margin">Maius regno contemnere reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> vnprofitable, and when they are thus abused, hurtful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious: which who so do, they shew greater and more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian magnanimity in this contempt, then others in affecting or hauing obtained by raigning in all their royalty. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample whereof we haue in <hi>Gedeon,</hi> who was more enobled<note place="margin">Iudg. 8. 23.</note> for denying a kingdome when it was offered vnto him; then his son <hi>Abimilech</hi> who with cruell and vnnaturall ambition aspired vnto it.</p>
               <p>But let vs consider of some reasons which may shew the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:10731:207"/> worthlesse vanity of worldly kingdomes, in comparison of<note place="margin">and incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which a kingdom bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with it.</note> Gods spirituall graces or heauenly ioyes: the first may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the manifold troubles and incumbrances which a kingdome bringeth with it, euen to those who iustly come by it, and wisely manage it; the which are so innumerable, irksome and burthensome; that if men were not more sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with ambition, then with reason, they would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for wearines to sincke vnder the waight, and to vnload themselues of this intolerable greatnes, to find ease in a more priuate life. Of this the Heathen Monarch hauing experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, said vnto one who admired his happines, and measured his inward comfort and contentment by his outward rule; If (saith he) thou diddest know with how many euils this Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem<note place="margin">Antigonus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Stobaeum.

The truth hereof may be more euident, if we cōsider but some few particulars: for first, vnto what wearying and wasting care is euen a good King subiect vnto, whilest he desireth and studieth to act well his kingly part, so as he may haue the applause of God and his Angels, and that both in respect of himselfe, and also that which he taketh for his subiects? And for himselfe, both in regard of his person and priuate actions, and also in regard of his place and publike gouernment. For the first, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For he considereth that the Princes life and manners, are the square and rule according to which his subiects frame themselues in their whole course and conuersation: and therefore he seeth how much it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth him that the square be straight, lest the worke be crooked, and the whole common-wealth brought out of<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Si vis tibi om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia subijcere subijce te ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni: multos regis, si te ratio regat.</hi> Senec. epist. 34.</note> frame: he knoweth that he ruleth ouer reasonable creatures, and therefore studieth first to conforme himselfe to the rule of reason in all his actions, that so they may the better subiect themselues vnto his gouernment, and may suffer him to rule
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:10731:207"/> as well in their hearts as in their outward actions. He findeth by experience that Princes examples are most effectuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, either to good or euill, and that their liues are more powerfull then his lawes to incline and moue, to the better or worser part: and therefore he spendeth himselfe in studying this diuine oratorie, that his life and example may speak good things vnto his people. He considereth that Kings errors are like the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Iob 34. 19.</note>
                  <hi>regardeth the rich more then the poore.</hi> In regard whereof, his care is great and continuall, not how he may rule according to his will, but according to reason and law, making loue and awefull maiestie, seuerity and sweetnes, mercie and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, to striue which shall haue the preheminence, or rather neuer to striue, because he tempereth them with true iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and wisdome in a heauenly harmonie. He considereth that as he is a King, so also he is the father of his countrey: for what is a common-wealth but a great familie, ouer which God hath set Princes as parents, not only to rule, but also to prouide for, preserue and defend them? and therefore how great his care must needs be, to nourish and protect so great a charge, let priuate fathers iudge, who find enough to do, to order and prouide for their small company. Yea he discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth plainly, that a King in the common-wealth is like the soule in the body, which howsoeuer it be not directly &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:10731:208"/> touched and affected, either with the delights it casteth, or with the griefes and miseries which it indureth; yet doth it communicate in both, by sympathie and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling: and therefore he doth not lay vpon his subiects hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie burthens, because he also is pinched with that waight which oppresseth them; he enuieth not, but greatly reioiceth in their prosperity, because he communicates with them in their contentment; and if for the good of the whole body of the common-wealth, he find it necessary to receiue, rather then take of their goods, that they may inioy the rest with peace and comfort, he only croppeth them, or rather pruneth them, that they may grow the better, and doth not stocke<note place="margin">

Finally, good princes remember that they are Gods deputies, and therefore their care is that they may be like him, not hauing their greatnes to exceed their goodnes, but as their power inableth them to do what they will, so their goodnes limiteth them to the doing of that which is profitable for their subiects: the which their care is so much more vigilant, because they know that there will be an end of their Lieutenantship, when as they shall be called to an account of their gouernment, and receiue either the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their iustice, or the punishment of their corruptions, and ill-deseruing.</p>
               <p>Finally, as the good Prince is continually troubled with<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 5. The care which a King taketh in respect of his. subiects.</hi>
                  </note> care about himselfe, that he may performe his dutie: so he taketh no lesse care, that these duties performed may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the good and welfare of his subiects: as for example, that by his wisdome and prouidence, they may haue both neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries and sufficient plentie, that by his discreet gouernment they may be kept in good order, that by his administration of iustice, euery one may possesse his owne right, and be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued from wrongs and iniuries: and finally, that by his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection and power, his subiects may be protected from forren forces, and inioy secure peace. For being the father of
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:10731:208"/> his countrey, he is with a fatherly affection to care for the good of his children, as well as his owne, he is the skilfull pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot in this great ship of the common-wealth, who sitteth at the sterne, and ordereth all for the preseruation, not only of himselfe, but also the whole ship, and all the passengers who haue committed themselues to his care and prouidence. And as it is not enough for the rule or square to be straight it selfe, but it must also serue as the instrument to make other things conformable to it owne straightnesse, and to leuell and make euen the whole worke: so it is not enough for a good prince that he be in himselfe vpright, iust, and furnished with al ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which become a priuate man; but his care must also bee that those that are committed to his charge and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may communicate with him in all vertue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, because he is a publicke person, and the head of this great body which must gouerne and direct his members, as shall be most honorable for himselfe and profitable for them. Now although this necessitie of taking extraordinarie care for his owne person, and all the rest of his subiects be an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie necessitie, because it forceth to that which is good; and howsoeuer hee may haue comfort in the fruits thereof, yet who knoweth not that in it selfe it is vnpleasant and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some; and so bitter and distastefull that it may well weane any from the loue of greatnes?</p>

Wee know that the pilote as hee hath the greatest rule in the ship, so hee hath the greatest part in the paines and labour; for his mind is exercised whilest others are at rest, and watcheth at the sterne whilest the passengers securely sleepe.

But of all other passions they are most troubled and perplexed with feare, it being a thing necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that they whom many feare, should also themselues feare many; and that they who intermeddle with manifold busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of great nature, and that oft times betweene aduerse parties, must needs incurre the hatred of many, and together with hatred perill and danger. Neither doth the multitude of enemies so much amate them as because they are secret and vnknowne, nor their force so much as their hidden treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. For as the bullet is more dangerous then the sword, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause killing before it is discouered, there is no ward for it: so these vnexpected blowes of traitours, being giuen secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and at vnawares, are much more to be feared then the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of professed enemies, because they wound &amp; giue no warning. Now these secret foes are much more common to princes then open enemies; seeing their greatnes is no more apt to stir vp enmitie against them, then to worke a care in those in whom it is bred to hide and conceale it, because here especially professed hatred taketh away opportunitie of reuenge, and turneth the mischiefe vpon his head that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it. In regard whereof princes, whilest they know not whom to feare, are apt to feare all, and vpon small occasions<note place="margin">Multò peius est regibus quam seruien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, quia isti singulos, illi v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersos timēt.</note> to haue euen those whom they haue chosen to guard them in iealousie and suspition.

And as they are much endangered through enuie, so no lesse by the hatred of their inferiours; for if they should find no other fault in them to prouoke their malice; euen their goodnes is a sufficient argument to make them hated of the wicked, and their vpright administring of iustice is enough to make them abhorred of the lewde and licencious; in which regard princes must make account either by doing of their dutie to be hated of men, or by neglecting it to bee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God; to sit still and doe nothing worth the doing, or by atchieuing worthie actions fit for their greatnesse, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger themselues to the treacherous practises of the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. Besides these dangers; vnto which enuie and malice exposes them at home, they are more endangered then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in respect of open enemies and forraine forces: for it is not to supplant priuate men that armies are leuied, but the king is the marke at which they leuell; whose life to them is more then the destruction of ten thousand subiects, because it is no lesse mortall to the common-wealth when the head is cut off, then if the whole body were mangled in peeces. Neither are they more endangered by enemies then by false friends, seeing experience teacheth that many who haue escaped safe from all the attempts and forces of their professed foes, haue beene catched in the priuie snares, and secret treacheries, which those whom they accounted their dearest friends haue laid and plotted against them. For it is impossible for these great potentates to satisfie the desires of all that depend vpon them, and by preferring some before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they procure the secret hatred of the rest, whom pride<note place="margin">2.

Now these dangers are more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and more deepely, and that iustly apprehended of Kings, then of subiects, not only for that they haue more to lose then the ordinarie sort, but also because they extend to the no lesse hurt of the common-wealth, then of themselues, which good Princes loue better then their owne liues: for when the Prince is hurt the whole countrie bleedeth at his wounds; and when this great shepheard is smitten, then the silly sheepe are scattered and indangered to the rapine of the rauenous wolfe.</p>

Then must they giue a reckoning of their owne life, whether they haue shined as lights before their people, and led them in the waies of godlines by their good example; or contrariwise haue scandalized them by their euill liues, and mislead them into the by-paths of sinne as presidents of wickednes. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they must be accountable at that day, for not only all those sinnes which themselues haue committed, but also for all those committed by their subiects, vnto which they haue been either principals, by their commandement, or accessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries through their conniuencie, and neglect of the execution of iustice.

A notable place to this purpose we haue in the sixth chapter of the booke of Wisdome, vnto which for breuitie sake I referre the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.<note place="margin">Wisd. chap. 6. vers. 1. to the tenth.

In the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect tyrants and wicked Kings are most miserable in the middest of all their royaltie and maiestie, being continually haunted with these feares, as with hellish furies, and so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted through the guilt of their owne consciences, that they are neuer at rest, nor haue any peace or true ioy in their
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:10731:212"/> hearts, in the middest of all their outward mirth and iollity, they feare company alike and solitarines; that for feare of assault, and this for want of helpe. In the day time they sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome looke straight forward for feare of being surprised at vnawares, but commonly they looke askew with many sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den turnings, as though they were in a crowd of enemies, and looked who should giue the first stab. Neither haue they more rest in the night; for hearing the least noise waking, they suspect a conspiracie; and being asleepe, they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted with terrible dreames, and fearefull visions. They are so much in feare of their enemies that they are neuer quiet till hauing contriued their ruine, they haue also brought them to destruction. And of their friends so iealous and suspitious, that the least occasion turneth the confidence which they haue of their fidelity into doubting and distrust, which being a little nourished with selfe-guiltinesse, their friendship is turned into enmitie, and their loue into mortall hatred.

And well were it with tyrants if this were all their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to haue a shamefull death after a sinfull life: but this is but the beginning of their miserie; for after this first punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of bodilie destruction, inflicted vpon them as it were at the quarter sessions; there is a farre greater reserued for the time of Gods generall assises, euen the eternall death and condemnation both of their bodies and soules, as a iust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of all their oppressions, iniuries, cruelties and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages which they haue offered against their brethren, for whose good and preseruation al their power of gouernment was by God committed to them.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I briefly shewed the manifold euils which<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 14. Of the spirituall kingdome which euery one should labour after.</hi>
                  </note> accompanie kingdoms, whether they be wel vsed or abused; al which may serue as reasons to shew their worthlesnes, and to incite all, that if they will needs be ambicious, they would aspire to kingdomes of greater value and excellencie; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that soueraignty and regiment which is spiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly. And first, that they spiritually raigne whilest they continue on earth, that so they may continually raigne in the kingdome of heauen. So the authour of the booke of Wisedome exhorteth: <hi>If your delight</hi> (saith hee) <hi>bee in thrones</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wisd. 6. 21.</note>
                  <hi>and scepters, O kings of the people, honour wisedome, that ye may raigne for euer.</hi> Now this regiment is chiefly exercised in our selues, when as deposing sinne from raigning in our mortall
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:10731:213"/> bodies, we doe erect in vs the kingdome of Iesus Christ, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him to raigne in vs by his word and holy spirit. And when by vertue hereof our reason being sanctified and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, doth raigne and rule ouer our corrupt affections and vnrulie passions, reforming some which may be seruiceable, and subduing, mortifying, and slaughtering others which are vnprofitable and vnamendable; especially when as wee<note place="margin">

               <p>Finally, if we will needs raigne as kings, let vs not affect<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 15. That we are to labour after the kingdome of heauen.</hi> 2. Tim. 2. 12.</note> and set our hearts vpon earthly kingdomes, but rather let vs bee content here in this vale of teares to suffer with Iesus Christ, that we may eternally raigne with him. Let vs not aspire vnto worldly monarchies, where the impossibility of obtaining may iustly free vs from affecting and hoping; for as the world hath but one sunne, so a kingdome admits but of one soueraigne; but let vs seate our affections in heauen, where we shall all raigne as kings, and yet one not any whit<note place="margin">Apoc. 22. 5.</note> lessen anothers dominions; but the greater the number is, the greater is the royalty and glory of all, the greater also is their ioy and happinesse. Finally, let vs not much affect this earthly soueraignty, which is accompanied with so many cares, troubles, labours, feares and dangers; but rather let vs set our harts vpon that kingdome of peace and glory, where there is no care to disturbe our quietnesse, no trouble to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our happinesse, no griefe to distast our ioyes, no feares nor dangers to disquiet our minds; but secure rest, vnspeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able happinesse, glory without measure, and ioyes without end; which whosoeuer seeke shall surely find, and hauing attained to it, shall neither bee disturbed in it, nor depriued of it.</p>

                  </note> honours and preferments. Let vs in the next place consider of worldly riches; which if we throughly examine we shall find, that howsoeuer worldlings make such high ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them that they prefer them before the saluation of their soules; yet they are in truth if wee compare them with Gods spirituall graces and heauenly ioyes, vaine, worthlesse, and void of excellencie. For if honours which are esteemed more excellent, are, as we haue shewed, vaine &amp; of no worth; and pleasures which are more sweet and comfortable, are (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus compared) of no value or esteeme, as wee shall see hereafter▪ then how great is the vanity, and how small the excellencie of worldly riches, which are of a more base and contemptible nature, being but as it were seruants vnto the other, which are only desired and prouided to serue for their vses and imployments? Neither doth any man (vnlesse it bee some sottish misers, who in getting riches haue lost their wits) esteeme of riches for their owne sake, but as they serue for their vse, either to aduance their honour and reputation by bestowing them bountifully, where they may haue most credit; or for the obtaining and enioying of their pleasures and delights: to which purpose serue stately houses and rich furniture, pleasant gardens, and fruitfull orchards; daintie faire, and soft clothing; which ends if riches aduanced not, they would like contemptible garbage rest vntouched in the earths bowels without any to admire or sue for them. Now if these ends themselues which are their chiefe good be void of excellency and full of vanity; then how vaine and worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse are these base riches, which in an abiect subiection serue but as it were to hold the stirrup to mount men vp into the seate of honour; or for porters to open vnto them the doore of pleasures? And this was the cause why the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8.</note>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:10731:214"/> so lightly valued them, that comparing them with Christ and his righteousnesse, hee esteemed them no better then dung; which if it be not vaine and base enough to shew their vanity because it is of some vse and profit, consider that the wise <hi>Salomon</hi> valueth them by that which is yet of lesse worth, calling them nothing: <hi>Wilt thou</hi> (saith he) <hi>cast thine</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 23. 5.</note>
                  <hi>eyes vpon it which is nothing?</hi> and lest yet this nothing should haue some esteeme, as doing no hurt, though it do no good: the Apostle further telleth vs in the former place, that he esteemed the things of this world as losse, which is worse then nothing, that he might win Christ, and be partaker of his righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>But let vs consider of the worthlesse vanity of worldly<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. Of the vanitie of great lands and large Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.</hi>
                  </note> wealth in some particulars: and first, what great excellencie is there in large Lordships, and great lands; seeing the whole earth is not so big as a pease, in comparison of our heauenly countrey; and yet they who hold the greatest possessions, haue not so much as a little prick or point in this small globe of the world: and therefore (as sometime <hi>Socrates</hi> said to <hi>Alcibiades</hi>) haue not so much when they glory most in it, as may haue the least place, or smallest resemblance in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test map? What worth or excellencie is in them, because they hold them in fee-simple, and haue them as perpetuities annexed to their successours, seeing though they should thus continue to the end of the world, it were but a moment of time in respect of eternitie? and yet the longest liuer hath but a small part of this moment, euen to the short period of his owne life: so that to him notwithstanding the glorious titles of fee-simples and perpetuities, his inheritance and possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are but momentany, and as it were tenements holden at will, out of which he is ready daily to be turned at the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords pleasure. And yet these small lands oftentimes bring with them no small incumbrance; seeing as an heauie loade they oppresse mens minds, so as they cannot mount vp alost in heauenly meditations, nor haue their conuersation in their owne countrey, being clogged with this lumpe of earth: and these momentany possessions, are causes vnto many of no momentany mischiefe; seeing they depriue them of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:10731:215"/> inheritance, when they set their hearts vpon them: especially if (as the Prophet speaketh) they haue vsed oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to inlarge their lordships, ioyning house to house, and field to field, inclosing commons and dispeopling townes,<note place="margin">Esay 5. 8.</note> that the poore being rooted out, they may place themselues alone in the middest of the earth: by which cruelty inlarging their possessions which are but momentany, they make themselues subiect to an eternall woe, and most fearefull malediction.</p>
               <p>Neither is there more excellencie or worth in gold and<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. Of the vanity of gold and siluer.</hi> Eccles. 2. 8. 11.</note> siluer, which by the wise <hi>Salomon</hi> are reckoned and raunged among those vanities, which bring no good to the owners, but vexation of spirit, and by the Prophet directed by Gods Spirit, they are called thicke clay, which haue their value and<note place="margin">Habac. 2. 6.</note> preheminence aboue other earth, because they are a little more shining and refined; neither haue they their worth and value from nature, but from mens opinions. For (as one no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth)<note place="margin">Chrysost. in 1. Tim. 6. Hom. 17.</note> those things which are naturally excellent, do shew their owne excellencie without any mount-bancke to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, or to set them out to the shew, as the sugar his sweetnes, the Sunne his brightnes, and the earth his fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: but these wares which are of imaginary worth, need a monitour to tell vs of their excellencie, or otherwise we should not know, much lesse admire them. For if we do see copper gilt, we are delighted with the beauty of the mettall, and we call it gold; but when those which are more skilfull come and admonish vs that we are deceiued, our errour and admiring wonder leane vs both together. Moreouer, we see<note place="margin">Senec. epist. 94.</note> that God in the very placing of these mettals, would take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from vs all opinion of their worth and excellencie: for whereas the Lord hath placed his creatures according to their dignity (man only excepted, who is in the place of his exile and banishment) as the holy Angels in the highest hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the Sunne, Moone and Starres in the firmament, the elements as they are more pure, so in place one superiour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another: he hath seated these so much admired mettals, in the intrals of the most grosse element, as though he would haue vs so farre from setting them vpon our heads, or our

Which also seemeth to haue been practised by the Primitiue Church, who deliuered not the price of their possessions into the Apostles hands, but cast them at their feet, to shew how meanely they accounted of them. And as he hath placed them in this inferiour place, as fit to be contemned, so also in the hidden cauernes of the earth, far remote from humane sight, out of which they are not gotten without infinit toile and labour; that he might hereby withdraw our greedy eye from looking after them, and our couetous hearts from desiring them; or at least though we should couet them, yet we might be discouraged with this intollerable paines in the pursuite of these worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse vanities: besides, he hath not there seated them in their beauty and perfection, fined and purified, but in their oare, vnsightly and base to looke vpon, as hauing in it much more drosse then pure mettall; from which it is not purged and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined without endlesse moile, and labour of the workemen: who besides all their paines haue their health thereby so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and their faces blemished with swartnes and dead palenes, that they seeme to haue taken vpon them the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the mettall, and to haue bin content to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vgly, that it may receiue beautie and brightnes. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all which, vaine man doting vpon this worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse pelfe, is not discouraged with all these labours, but is content to spend his life and strength in searching and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, digging &amp; mining, purging and refining of this earthy drosse, not caring to lose himselfe that he may find it; and that which is worst of all, when by the worke of his owne hands he hath brought it to his full beauty and perfection, he doth not only make it his chiefe ornament, who is much more comely and gracefull in himselfe, placing it aboue his head, which God had seated vnder his feet, but also erecteth it as his idoll in his heart, and as it were falleth downe before it to adore and worship it, whilest he loueth, trusteth and hopeth in it more then in God himselfe: wherby it commeth to passe that their soules are more deformed who possesse it, then their bodies who in the mines digged for it; and more
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:10731:216"/> indangered to death eternall, then they to any temporarie perils: for howsoeuer their gold it self shall be vnto them but a momentany good, yet the rust thereof shall continue to the day of iudgement, to be a witnes against them for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and condemnation, as the Apostle speaketh. Seeing<note place="margin">Iames 5. 3.</note> therefore these base minerals are in themselues so contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, and bring vnto vs so little profit, and oftentimes no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hurt: we may well admire, and euen be astonished at the cause, why men should so dote vpon them, louing them so dearely, and the ioyes of heauen so slightly, and taking so<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fascinatio quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam est huius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi res, quòd aurum et argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum à nobis tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti pendatur, &amp; animarum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strarum nulla cura.</hi> Chrysost. in 1.

So as it may seeme that there is in them a kind of witchcraft which thus sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth and abuseth their admirers, seeing there is no reason to be giuen, either in nature or religion, why men should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne those eternall treasures and heauenly excellencies, and pursue with a besotted and madding affection, this earthly trash and base vanities. Let vs therefore learne wisely to stop our eares against these charmes; and howsoeuer we are not vtterly and absolutely to reiect gold and siluer, as being the creatures of God: which (as hath bin shewed) may serue for good vse; yet let vs take heed that we do not set our hearts vpon them, but contemne and despise them, when they come in comparison with Gods spirituall graces, or our heauenly patrimonie: and making account of money, as trauellers of their prouision for their iourney, which being moderate ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for their vse, and to helpe them forward; but being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue and superfluous, toileth them as an heauie burthen,<note place="margin">

               <p>Neither is there lesse vanity, or more worth in other kinds<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. Of the vanity of rich iewels and costly furniture.</hi>
                  </note> of riches: for what true excellencie is in rich iewels and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious stones, which are by the Creator contemptibly, cast vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth and sands with worthlesse regard; but being
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:10731:216"/> sought and found by men, are sold at such high rates, as not their owne worth, but the buyers phantasie sets vpon them: in regard whereof the same iewell or stone altereth the price according to the worth of the owner; and that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed in the hand of a poore man at a small value, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth precious and of great worth when a richer and more noble master is owner of it. So that these are commended by their rarity more then by their excellency; by opinion rather then sound reason; by the wealth of their owners, rather then by their owne worth, and are in truth meere trifles for wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons to play with, rather then any solide or substantiall good, which brings true profit to those who are possessed of them. The like also may bee said of rich furniture, and sumptuous houshold stuffe, which in comparison of those more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things, are meere vanities and worthlesse trifles: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any cause why any man should much desire these things if hee want them, or glory in them if wee haue them; for the chiefe ornaments of a house are not gorgeous hangings, rich beds and such like furniture; but the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and graces of the inhabitants, the wisedome and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet gouernment of superiors, the dutie and obedience of inferiours, with piety, honesty, and good order obserued of all.

Againe, the great labour which these things of small worth require, may serue to weane the harts of any from them who are not too ful of pride &amp; vaine glory: for as at first they are not easily gotten; so they are kept with no lesse difficultie, there neuer wanting occasion of looking to them, folding, vnfolding, brushing, cleansing, altering, remouing; to say nothing of the manifold discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and occasions of anger which they bring to the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if any of them chance to miscarie, or to be misused. In al which the trouble and griefe oftentimes▪ exceed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and contentment which they bring vnto them. Or if
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:10731:217"/> there be such care, prouidence and paines vsed, that none of these things happen, but all is preserued in his full beautie and good order; then is it a manifest signe that most of their time is spent about these vanities, and the whole mind so wholly possessed and taken vp with them, that the soule is neglected, and little or no paines taken to decke it with the rich ornaments of Gods spirituall and sanctifying graces; so that when one commeth into a rich mans house where there<note place="margin">Basil. <hi>in diuites auaros,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 7.</note> is such costly furniture, so curiously and carefully disposed and ordered, he may probablie suspect that hee seeth all the goodnesse of that house at the first view; and that there is nothing better then that which presenteth it selfe in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shew. Furthermore, wee are to know that these glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things bring to the owners no lasting delight, or dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contentment: for howsoeuer whilest they haue them but in their desires, or are newly possessed of them, they take great pleasure to thinke vpon and behold them; yet when as they haue them continually in their eye, and that they are become common and ordinarie, their delight presently cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth; especially if they chance to see more rich and costly things of the same kind in the possession of other men. And no maruell, for if the sunne it selfe because wee see it daily worketh no extraordinarie delight, although the darke night comming between his setting and rising, setteth some edge on our tired affections; how much lesse are wee to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that we can find it in these earthly trifles, whose chiefe glory being compared to the sunnes brightnesse, is but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity and grosse darkenesse? Finally, the more wee abound with these rich furnitures, the more are wee exposed to the feare and danger of fire, theeues, yea sillie moaths, which howsoeuer they be base and contemptible, yet haue they po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer enough to pull downe this pride, and to consume the matter and occasion of this vaine glory: or if all these with prouidence be preuented, yet these glorious shewes doe sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome faile to expose vs to enuie, which vsuallie feedeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these outward appearances of worldly happinesse, and feeding pineth those whom it possesseth, because they want the meanes to make ostentation of such pompe and glorie.
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:10731:217"/> Seeing therefore these things are not onely full of vanitie, but also of many euils and inconueniences, how much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were this cost bestowed vpon the poore members of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ then vpon these needlesse superfluities, manie whereof are so fine and costlie, that the owners can neuer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most find in their hearts to vse them, but keepe them locked vp in their chests not suffering them to see the sunne, vnlesse vpon some speciall occasion, which hapneth not once in a yeere, when as pride meaneth to triumph in all it brauerie, and causeth them to make ostentation of al their glory?

Lastly, it may well weane our hearts from being in loue with this riotous excesse, if we consider that it will make our account more hard and difficult at the day of iudgement. For how doe we thinke will this reckoning bee accepted of our Lord and Iudge, when as wee haue spent his talents vpon needlesse superfluities, and suffered the poore members of Iesus Christ, for whose vse also wee receiued them, to want necessaries? when as we haue adorned our walles with arras and tapestry, and suffered men created after Gods image, yea our brethren and fellow members of the same body, to starue for want of freese to couer their nakednes? when our horses<note place="margin">

Let vs in the next place consider of statelie houses and sumptuous buildings, wherein worldlie men so much glorie and delight; in which after due examination we shall find no more excellencie, or lesse vanitie. And first, if we will credit the wise <hi>Salomon</hi> (who hauing for a time his affection greatlie set vpon them, wanted neither witcuriouslie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue his stately buildings for most conuenient vse, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test state and glory, nor yet wealth to second his inuentions) hee will tell vs on his owne experience, that when in this kind wee haue done all wee can, yea all wee will, and in our hearts desire; we shall in the end of all our cost and labour, find nothing but vanitie and vexation of spirit. Againe, if<note place="margin">Eccles. 2. 4. 11.</note> there were any excellencie in these sumptuous buildings, it is chieflie the glorie and praise of the builders and worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whose art and skill is hereby commended, and not of the workemaster and owner, who had no other part to act in these workes, but to disburse the money and beate the charge. The house therefore doth not grace the inhabitant, but he his habitation, when as he maketh it an holie temple for religious duties, a mansion for vertue and good order, the seate of good hospitalitie, and a place of refuge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe for the needie and afflicted. Neither will these statelie buildings greatlie profit vs, for they do not bring to the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners any sound ioy, quiet and contentation, which dwell more often in poore cottages then in statelie palaces. They doe not free vs from care and griefe, wherewith statelie buildings are often pestred, when as thatched houses are priuiledged and exempted. They doe not preserue their lords from the encounters of sicknesses and diseases; yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there lieth an open passage to let in gouts, palsies, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes, consumptions, when as they are kept out from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring such slender buildings, as will scarce beare off a storme, or hold out raine. The thicknesse of their stone or well tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred walles, nor the strength of their nailed gates will serue to keepe out death; neither will the height of their buildings make him neede a skaling ladder, when hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:10731:218"/> to assult their liues; for when he knocketh the doores flie open, and he findeth an easie passage into their secret chambers. Furthermore, let vs consider that the most sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous buildings haue within a while a time of ruine; and though they are assaulted with no outward violence, yet they haue their periods, when as they will fall with their owne waight. Besides, oftentimes they come through fire, forren<note place="margin">

And where are their builders, which in all this cost affected a name, but rotten and consumed in the graue, without name or memorie? Lastly, let vs remember that these stately hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are seldome erected without oppression, for either <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths</hi> vineyard lieth neere vnto them, which if he loue his life he must sell them, because it is conuenient to make them a garden; or the poores houses stand on the best seat and must giue place, or hinder their prospect, and must be pulled downe, or else they must gratifie them, though for feare more then loue, with their labour, carts and carriages, without wages or reward. By which courses, when these sumptuous and beautifull buildings are erected, a grieuous woe and heauie curse lieth vpon the owners: <hi>Woe vnto him</hi> (saith the<note place="margin">Ierem. 22. 13. 15. 16.</note> Prophet) <hi>that buildeth his house by vnrighteousnesse, and his chambers without equitie: he vseth his neighbour without wages, and giueth him not for his worke,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Shalt thou raigne because thou closest thy selfe in Cedar; did not thy father</hi> (though he dwelt in more homely buildings) <hi>eat and drinke and prosper, when he executed iudgement and iustice? when he iudged the cause of the afflicted and poore, he prospered,</hi> &amp;c. The like woe the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> thundreth out against those, <hi>who ioyne house</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esay. 5. 8. 9.</note>
                  <hi>to house</hi> laying on them this curse from God, that <hi>their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses should be desolate, and though they were great and faire, yet they should be without any inhabitant;</hi> according to that male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction denounced in the law, <hi>thou shalt build an house and not
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:10731:219"/> dwell therein.</hi> Which curse lieth heauie vpon many builders in these daies, though they neuer thinke vpon their burthen, who make stately houses and neuer inhabit them, and spend all in building, but nothing in hospitalitie; as though the vse of building were only, like the pyramides of Egypt, to make a glorious shew; and as though they had no other induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be at all this charge and labour, then those had that built the tower of Babel, that is, to threaten heauen with their houses height, and get a name vnto themselues vpon the earth. Seeing therefore these sumptuous buildings are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies vaine and worthlesse, and often accompanied with sinne and wickednes; let vs learne (though the world and worldlings so highly value them) to contemne and thinke basely of thē, lobouring to be inhabitants of that Diuine and Angelicall habitation, which is <hi>not made with hands, but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 1.</note>
                  <hi>in the heauens.</hi> And when beholding these stately houses on earth, we begin to be besotted with their momentanie beautie and false glory; let vs presently cast vp our eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heauen; and if hauing seated our minds and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vpon that heauenly and diuine beautie, we do from thence reflect our eyes vpon the chiefe glory of earthly buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, they will seeme but as childrens houses, which in play they build vpon the sands, which euery blast of wind defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, and euery waue of water washeth away; and as the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of spiders, which being made with great labour, are with themselues easily brushed away with a wing or broome. For then we will easily conclude, that if there be such goodly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitatiōs in our pilgrimage &amp; place of punishmēt, then much more glorious mansions are prepared for vs in our owne countrey, where the Lord is purposed to glorifie and reward vs: if Gods enemies haue such stately palaces on earth, then how much more excellent hath the Lord prouided for his children in heauen? If the great Monarches of the world haue mansion houses befitting their might and maiesty; then how glorious is the Court of heauen, and chiefe mansion house of the King of Kings, which he hath purposely fitted and prepared, as is most beseeming his glory and greatnesse? Surely being sutable and agreeable vnto his Maiestie, which
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:10731:219"/> is infinite, it must needs also be of vnspeakeable and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehēsible excellencie. If the world haue such a goodly vaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted roofe, beautified with such glorious lights, and imbel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished with such shining starres; then what shall we thinke of our heauenly habitation, whose floore is much more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then this stately roofe? Finally, if the Kings of the earth haue their marble, iuory and ieat, to adorne their buildings, then may we well conceiue that which the Apostle saw,<note place="margin">Apocal. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> namely, that our heauenly citie is of much more pretious stuffe, the walles of jasper, garnished with all manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious stones, the gates of pearle, and the streets of gold. And therefore if we affect stately buildings, let vs contemne these base cottages on earth, and labour to be owners of those glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and heauenly habitations; which as they are by infinit degrees more goodly, and excellent, so are they also euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting habitations, which neuer need repaire, nor any whit abate of their first glorie.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I shewed the vanitie of sumptuous buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. The vanitie of a numerous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie.</hi>
                  </note> Let vs in the next place consider if there be any more worth &amp; excellency in many seruāts, &amp; a great retinue; where also we shall find, that howsoeuer it is accounted a glorious thing in the world, to haue a multitude of attendants, and a great traine attending at their masters heeles, yet it is but a meere vanitie, yea if it be possible, more vaine then any of the former. And this also appeareth by the testimony of the wise <hi>Salomon,</hi> speaking vpon his owne experience, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king herein for some worldly happines, missed of it; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing retained such a multitude of seruants, as serued not only for his necessarie vse, but also for pompe and state, for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure<note place="margin">Eccles. 2. 7. 11.</note> and delight; concludeth of this as of the rest, that he found nothing in it, <hi>but meere vanitie and vexation of spirit.</hi> Vnto which testimonie we may adde diuers reasons, which shew the worthlesnes of this great attendance: for howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a man hath hereby from the mouthes of many, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Qui multorum est dominus, idem multorum seruus esse cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> Chrysost. in Rom. 16. 3.</note> titles of lord and master, and the outward reuerence of cap and knee, yet what is he in truth, but a common seruant vnto them all, and euen as it were the steward of the family, who taketh the care and paines to prouide them of all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries?
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:10731:220"/> yea which is worse, hereby he becommeth a seruant to his own auarice and concupiscence, it being a chiefe cause and motiue which induceth him to toile and labour, scrape and rake together, to oppresse and incroch vpon other mens rights, that he may haue wherewith to maintaine this nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous multitude to attend vpon him. The which error were so much the lesse, if al these men thus intertained, were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wel-lwillers, and (as one calleth them) humble friends,<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> readie at all assayes to seeke his good, and to stand in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence with their owne hazard: but contrariwise experience teacheth, that among many seruants are many enemies, who because they are restrained of their willes, or punished for their faults, or not rewarded according to their expectation, though it may be aboue their deserts, maligne their master, and wait for occasion to shew their hatred. Now these do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall foes are of al others most dangerous, because they are no lesse priuie to al their masters infirmities, then ready to diuulge them vnderhand, where they may most disgrace him; neither can any thing he doth in the familie be hid from those who wish him worst, because as he hath many eies to obserue his hidden counsels and greatest secrets, so hath he also many tongues to reueale and vtter them: yea and that which for feare they but secretly whispered whilest they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the familie vnder the gouernment of their master, they are readie with professed malice to proclaime publikely when they haue left his seruice▪ and be vnder the rule of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vnlesse they be restrained more with feare of their new master, then with loue of the old, lest he might iustly suspect that he also shall receiue at their hands the like measure, when they leaue his seruice. Now this miserie is so much the more miserable, not only because it is impossible to preuent these dangers, which come by these secret traytors, who are hidden and vnknowne, but also because they are faine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly to nourish these vipers in their bosome, feeding, cloathing and rewarding them, when as they do them most hurt, and are readie vpon all occasions to plot against them any mischiefe. Vnto this we may adde, that where there is a multitude of seruants, there are also many contentions and
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:10731:220"/> domesticall quarrels, much brawling and wrangling, clamor, and noise; which must needs bee exceeding troublesome to the gouernour, when as hee must bee faine to be a stickler in these fraies, and euery hand-while bee disquieted himselfe that he may set them at quiet, and accord their differences and contentions: yea but at least where there are many hands there is an easie and quick dispatch of houshold busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and all things are done seasonablie and in good order, to the contentment of the master; surely nothing lesse. Yea contrariwise, vnlesse there bee an exceeding wise and strict gouernment, there as are most seruitours, there is worst ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, disorder, negligence and confusion: either because the slothfull are incouraged to continue in their idlenesse, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they may easilie hide it in a crowde, and fasten their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences and defaults vpon some of their fellowes; or because the diligent are discouraged in their painefull labours, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others marre that which they make; and also for that particular notice cannot well be taken of their gouernours, by reason of the multitude, of their wel-deseruing, that so they may receiue due praise and reward. Or finallie, because they strain courtesie, and put off the businesse to one another, thinking his fellow may do it as well as he; whereof it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, that that is neglected of all, which might bee done of many. Moreouer, hee who entertaineth a multitude of seruants, doth hereby wast and consume his estate, which might be much better spent, not onlie by continuall feeding so manie idle bellies, and clothing so manie backes; but also because where multitudes are, there is much lauishing, spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and rioting, none taking care to spare or saue any thing, because his faithfulnesse and frugalitie would not bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued among so manie; and therefore seeing all will bee spent, he thinketh best to do like his fellowes, and to take his share before all bee gone. To say nothing of their pilfering and purloyning for their owne vse; and their wastfull prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in bestowing vpon others their masters goods; if at least they can haue them as their instruments and deputies to doe their businesse, whilest they spend their time in pleasures or idlenesse. Finally, it is a thing of great difficultie to gouerne
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:10731:221"/> well such a multitude in the familie; to keepe them in good order, and to make them diligently to performe their duties to God, their master, and to one another: for if euerie one findeth it a hard matter to rule a few in such sort as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth; then surelie it must needs bee almost impossible to rule so many. And this commeth to passe, partly because the master among such a multitude cannot haue his eye at all times vpon all, to obserue their disposition, cariage and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour; and partlie because there is almost alwaies amongst a great number some corrupt and vicious, who, like scabbed sheepe in a flocke, infect and taint their fellowes with their wicked behauiour and conuersation. Lastly, what doe they else who entertaine a great multitude, but take vpon them a great charge, of which they must giue an account how they haue discharged it at the day of iudgement? For it is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for such to haue liued like good men, if they haue not also caried themselues as good masters; nor enough that they haue themselues serued God, vnles also they haue been carefull to make those vnder their gouernment to ioyne with them in the like seruice. And if so be through their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, either because they haue not encouraged them in good, or discouraged and restrained them from euill, they haue neglected their duty and liued wickedly; they shall be found accessarie vnto, and guiltie of their sinnes before God. Which if masters would but seriously thinke vpon, they would not be so much exalted and delighted to see the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousnesse of their numerous traine, as amated and affrighted to consider of the greatnesse and difficultie of their recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and account.</p>

                  </note> seruants, and a great retinue. The last thing wherein we will consider the vanitie of riches, is costlie and braue apparell; which is a thing so much esteemed among worldlings, that they place in it no
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:10731:221"/> small part of their happinesse, thinking themselues best when they are brauest, and most esteemed when they haue got on the richest suite. And this maketh them to set their hearts so vpon it, that they thinke no time too much, no cost too great, which is spent in adorning of themselues; yea they are ready to sell religion, conscience, and credit, to purchase this excessiue brauerie; and to commit all manner of wrongs and iniuries, oppression, and violence, to maintaine their gay and gorgeous apparrell. Which folly, that we also may not fal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, let vs learne basely to esteeme this, which the world so much admireth, and to contemne it as a trifling vanitie; which is not onely void of all worth and excellencie, but also through common abuse, subiect to much corruption and sinne. And yet lest for the abuse we should reiect the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vse, and cynically refuse that christian libertie, which God herein hath liberally allowed vnto vs; let vs in the first place consider, that there is a good and lawfull vse of these rich attires, and costly apparell; namely, when as they are well fitted and sorted vnto the calling of those that weare them. For as the Lord hath made diuers estates and degrees of men; so would he haue euery one to apparrell themselues according to their degree &amp; calling, that so these diuers or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and conditions of men may the better be distinguished the one from the other: kings with royall apparell, nobles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their nobility, with that which is rich and costly; gentlemen, as befitteth their gentrie; and the meaner sort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their qualitie and condition. The which diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence may lawfully appeare both in the matter, and also the forme of their garments. For in the former respect, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for those who are in high estate, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o weare silkes and vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uets, gold and siluer, iewels and precious stones; neither were these creatures causelesly created, but for the vse of men, and that not heathens, worldlings and infidels; but chiefly and principallie for Gods own children and seruants, who onely haue iust title and interest vnto them. The like difference there may also be in the forme or fashion of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell; for the king and the meane subiect, the courtier and the countrie man, the gentleman and yeoman, the old and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:10731:222"/> the yonger sort, as they are not to haue the same matter of their apparell; but one more costly, another more meane and cheape according to their qualitie; so is it fit that they should also differ and be distinguished in their seuerall fashions, as best befitteth euery ones degree and calling. And thus in the time of the law the priests had a peculiar kind of apparel<note place="margin">Zach. 13. 4.</note> allotted vnto them. The Prophets had their rough garments, whereby they were knowne: kings and queenes had their<note place="margin">Psal. 45.</note> royall ornaments; the man one kind of apparell, and the woman another, which was vnlawfull for them to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.<note place="margin">Deut. 22. 5.

And our Sauiour<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 22. 12. 35. &amp; 32. 2.</note> Christ the wisedome of his father, seemeth to allow vnto courts and kings houses, soft raiment and gorgeous appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, as beseeming those who in the world are aduanced to these high places. Yea but the Apostles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> doe<note place="margin">Luk. 7. 25.</note> forbid this brauerie and gorgeous garments as vnbeseeming christians. I answere, that their sayings are not to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 9.</note> as generall and absolute prohibitions; but onely as admonitions, whereby they withdrew them from setting their hearts vpon pride, vanity and brauery, as though they were things greatly to be esteemed and desired, to the end they might fix them vpon the spirituall ornaments of the<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 3. 4.</note> soule, Gods sanctifying and sauing graces, as being much more excellent; which also appeareth by the antithesis there vsed. Againe, this gorgeous apparell might be interdicted those christians vnto whom the Apostle wrote, as being in those daies for the most part of meane quality and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 25. 26▪</note> as the Apostle elsewhere affirmeth; and therefore howsoeuer it were lawfull in it selfe, yet it was altogether vnbeseeming their estate: besides that, the Church was then vnder grieuous persecutions, in which respect these costly ornaments were vnfit, as being a time of humiliation; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so because of the great wants of many the poore members of Christ, which the richer sort were to relieue, not only out of their superfluities, but euen out of such necessaries, as might otherwise haue well beseemed their place and calling.</p>

               <p>But I shall not need to say much of this argument in these daies, wherein men and women generally are fallen into the contrarie abuse of excesse, forgetting all respect of order or degree.

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:10731:223"/> going in their attire and habit like nobles, the yeomanry like the gentrie, cottagers like yeomen, citizens like courtiers, subiects like Princes, and seruants like master and mistresse, as though their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And therefore seeing this run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning canker hath infected and corrupted the whole bodie of our state, it were to be wished that our ancient lawes against this excesse were put in execution: or because our sores are growne so desperate, that they cannot be cured with ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<note place="margin">Clemens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandr.

               <p>Now these abuses of apparell are either in respect of the<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. Of the abuse of apparell, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of costli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>

In regard of the matter men shew their vanitie and sin; first, when in the cost bestowed on the stuffe, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed their calling or abilitie, wearing such things as are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue their estate, or more then their rents, reuenues, or other meanes may well maintaine.

<pb n="379" facs="tcp:10731:223"/> duties, yea pinch their owne bellies, that they may weare the most costly stuffes, and adorne their backes with silkes and veluets. So that we may iustly take vp that complaint vsed by<note place="margin">Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andr. Paeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog. li. 2. ca. 10.</note> an ancient of his times, namely, that whereas the thing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, should much exceed in value the couer or case in which it is contained; as the iewell the cabinet, the soule the bodie, the bodie the garment: now contrariwise, when as the bodie it selfe being set to sale, would not yeeld many groats, one suite of apparell wherewith it is adorned, is not bought for many pounds. Of which excesse of cost in maintaining pride, we might well be ashamed, if we considered y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> our first parents had no better cloathes of their owne making, then such as were made of fig-leaues; and when God prouided for them, their apparell was of no richer stuffe, then beasts skins, which were only fit to couer their nakednes, and to keepe them from the iniuries of the weather. Secondly, in respect of the matter, they offend who make choice of such stuffes as are so slight, as will serue to no vse, but to couer their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes (for which also sometimes they are vnprofitable) and are<note place="margin">

Wherein as they do much exceed their ancestors in costlines, who clothed themselues with the dearest, but yet most lasting stuffes; so do they take away one chiefe end of superfluous apparell, which was, when them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues had laid it aside, to clothe therewith the poore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>And as men sin in respect of the matter of their apparell, against their particular callings, by exceeding their state and meanes: so also they offend against their generall calling of Christianitie in respect of the forme and fashion, &amp; that both in the excesse and defect: for as Christians ought to looke that the matter of their apparell be not ouer costly; so also they should take special care that the fashion be graue, sober and modest. For so the Apostle requireth, that <hi>women should</hi>

                     </gap>tie, not with broydred haire, or gold, or pearles, or costly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell.</hi> And the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> likewise chargeth them that<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 3.</note>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:10731:224"/> their apparell should not <hi>be outward, as with broydred haire, and gold put about,</hi> &amp;c. Now in this respect people offend two waies: first, whenas they affect fashions, which are not graue and modest, but light, vaine and wanton; whereby they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly discouer the lasciuious lightnesse and vaine immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie of their hearts, and by hanging out this signe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continencie, do set their honesty to the sale. And of this kind are those habits and attires especially, which do not couer the naked parts, which God and nature would haue hid; as also when men effeminately affect fashions like vnto wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and women mannishly go in such apparell, as doth hardly distinguish them from men. Secondly, they offend through phantasticall pride, which moueth them as often to change their fashions, as the Cameleon his colour, a sinne vnto which our people in this land are exceedingly addicted, and therein notablie shew their vanitie and follie. For if constancie be an inseparable fruit of wisedome; so that they who are most wise, are most vnchangeable in their courses and actions, because at first they are able to discerne what is best, and knowing it adhere vnto it; whereof it is that God who is infinite in wisedome, is also immutable in al his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels; then must also by the same reason mutabilitie, and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall change, be a notable effect and signe of follie, which being not able to iudge of that which is good, often shifteth and changeth, that at last it might find it out. Againe, vpon this often change there followeth another mischiefe; for when they haue tired their wits, and runne through all fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which themselues can thinke vpon, they craue aid of forraine inuentions, and follow the fashions of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; sometimes the French, and sometimes the Italian, one while the Dutch, &amp; soone after the Spanish. Now it is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full not only to break the lawes and statutes of our countrie; but also the maners and customes, wherein they are not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant from Gods word; because it is a breach of humane societie, when so much as in our habit we differ from the rest. And as we are not to be ruled by the lawes of strangers: so<note place="margin">

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:10731:224"/> when we haue receiued them, we must constantly hold vs to them, that so they may in time grow customable among our selues. Neither must euery one according to his owne phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall humour varie from his countrie fashion, seeing that part is vglie and monstrous which agreeth not with the whole body; neither must he through vaine inconstancie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect strange fashions, for this also will induce him in time to imitate their vices and corruptions. In which respect God threatneth to punish euen princes and kings children (who a man would thinke should in this kind be allowed greatest libertie) <hi>because they were clothed with strange apparell,</hi> and<note place="margin">Zeph. 1. 8.</note> would not follow their countrie fashion. In the defect also men offend through slouenlie vnhandsomnesse, not caring how their apparell hangs vpon them, nor how beastlie and nastie their clothes are, so they keepe them from the cold; into which disorder they fall either through slothfull negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, because they would not bee at the labour of dressing themselues, or through affected pride, seeking for praise at the backe dore, and desiring to bee talked of, and to seeme notable for somewhat. But this also is vnlawfull; for the same Scripture which forbiddeth excesse in broidered haire, pearle and gold, doth also require that we should clothe our selues in handsome, decent and comelie apparell, as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth shamefastnesse and modestie.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 9. §. <hi>Sect. 6. Of the abuse of apparell, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the ends thereof, which are, honestie and profit.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, men offend in their apparell in respect of the ends thereof, the which are two, honestie and profit. In regard of the former, apparell is worne by man to couer his nakednes, and to hide his shame which after his fall insued by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of sinne. The other end is profit, which is two fold, first for necessarie vse; secondlie for honour and comelinesse. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell is necessarie vnto vs; for howsoeuer before the fall there was such a iust temperature of the aire, that it was not at all offensiue to mans naked bodie, and consequentlie in this behalfe there was no neede of garments; yet through sinne this temper being lost, and an inequality following of heate and cold, both intollerable vnto man, and hurtfull to his health, apparell became necessarie to preserue him from the outward iniuries of the weather, and to keepe him in an
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:10731:225"/> equall temperature. Secondly, apparell is profitable for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, honour and ornament, not onely as it couereth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall deformities; but also as it now maketh the bodie seeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and gracefull, which in it selfe was more comelie and beautifull before the fall. And this end the Apostle speaketh of, where he saith, that vpō <hi>those members of the body which we</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 23.</note>
                  <hi>thinke most vnhonest, we put more honestie on, and our vncomely parts haue more comelinesse on.</hi> And in the verse following, that <hi>God hath tempered the body together, and hath giuen the more honour to that part which lacked.</hi> And these are the ends of apparell; in which many failing doe shew much vanitie and sinne. For how manie are there in these daies who disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest themselues by their wanton and light garments, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring such as will not couer their nakednesse, but discouer their bare breasts to open view, whilest their apparell either<note place="margin">

                  </gap> hide them? How many are there who in apparelling themselues haue least respect to necessary vse, or to preserue their bodies from the iniuties of the weather, but affect thin and subtile fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, more then wholesome warmenesse; desiring rather to be adorned then clothed, and to delight others eyes, then to preserue their owne health? Finally, how manie are there who doe not honour their bodies with graue and decent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, but disgrace themselues with phantasticall fashions, and lasciuious habits; proclaiming by their outward gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their inward pride and wantonnesse, as though they would haue all men to take notice of their vanitie and lightnesse?</p>
               <p>And these are the abuses of apparell in respect of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 7. Of the abuse of costly apparell in respect of the common vse thereof.</hi>
                  </note> thereof. In regard of the vse also it is abused, when as gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous and costly apparell, which might sometimes bee law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully worne in respect of the dignitie of the person, is daily and ordinarilie put on, for greater ostentation of pride and vaine glorie. For as we may offend by wearing such rich and costlie garments as are aboue our state and calling; so when these might well beare it in due time and vpon fit occasion, we offend also when we shew excesse in neglecting these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and in keeping reuels all the yeere. And this
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:10731:225"/> was the sinne taxed in the rich glutton, not that hee was clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed<note place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> in purple and fine linnen; but because he was excessiue in respect of time, vsing these costly ornaments euerie day. In which respect men and women greatly offend in these times, who (not obseruing the course and custom of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, which hauing this rich attire befitting their callings vsed it sparinglie, at certaine great festiuals onely or some few extraordinarie meetings) do make it their dailie habite, and (as we say) worke-aday attire, as though the chiefe end of their comming into the world, were to pranke themselues in riotous pride, and superfluous brauerie.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I shewed in what respects apparel in which<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 8. Reasons to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade all from abuses in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell: be-cause God hath forbidden this excessiue bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie.</hi> 1. Tim. 2. 9. 10.</note> worldlings so much delight, is vaine and sinfull. Now in the next place let vs consider of some arguments which may weane vs from this vanitie, and may moue vs, both in our iudgements lightlie to value it, and in our affections to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise and contemne it. The first reason is, that God in the Scriptures hath forbidden this glorious and gorgeous appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, vnlesse it be to some persons, and at some times. So the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> giueth women in charge that <hi>they array them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in comely apparell, with shamefastnesse and modesty, not with broidered haire, or gold, or pearles, or costly apparell (but as it becommeth women which professe the feare of God) with good workes.</hi> Likewise the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> willeth them that <hi>their apparell should not be outward, as with broidered haire, and gold put about, or in putting on of ornaments; but that the hid man of the heart should bee vncorrupt, with a meeke and quiet spirit, which is before God a thing much set by.</hi> If therefore we would shew our obedience to our great Lord and master, we must not conforme our selues to the fashions of the world, by wearing such costly apparell, and glorious or garish habits, as beseeme not our place and calling. But alas such is the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the times, that people sticke not to come into the publicke congregation, where out of Gods word this pride and excesse is condemned, with their broidered, curled and frizled haire; gold, silkes, veluets, and excessiue brauerie, as though they would openly professe their disconformity with the Scriptures, and rebellious disobedience against
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:10731:226"/> God, in doing that which he forbiddeth before his face, and euen in that very time when by his word he doth condemne it: as if they should plainely say, I will not forsake the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, though it be neuer so much or oft forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Which as it is a great offence among our selues, so doth it scandalize pagans, infidels and worldlings much more, and as a stumbling blocke in the way hinders them from the profession of our religion, when as they heare our doctrine, and see our practise; obserue that the Scriptures which wee professe to beleeue, and propound as the rule, according to which we frame our liues, condemne and forbid this vanity, and wee euen when wee heare them read, vse that excessiue brauerie, which the heathens themselues would neuer tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we would cal to mind the first originall of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 9. The originall of apparell should preserue vs from taking pride in it.</hi>
                  </note> we should haue little cause to affect brauerie, or to wax proud of gay clothing; for had our first parents conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the state of innocencie, they should haue remained glorious in themselues, and not haue needed any apparell; but hauing transgressed Gods commandement they saw their nakednesse, and being ashamed of their deformities, they sought to hide themselues, and to couer their shame by the helpe of garments. In which respect what is our apparell but a daily monitour, to call our sins and shame to memorie? What is it but a Lazers cloth, cast ouer our filthy sores of sin, that we may not become lothsome through our deformities to our selues and others? and consequently what doe they which vaunt themselues in this vanity, but like the thiefe, who being adiudged to weare an haltar in perpetuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his foule crimes, doth make him one of silke, or gold twist, and seeing it to make a glittering shew, doth wax proud of that which should rather humble him, as being a continuall testimonie of his sinne and shame? so they wax proud of that which is the ensigne of their sinne and miserie, and conuert the habits which were giuen vs to hide our sins, into sinne it selfe. Againe, if we consider the vse of apparell in the first institution, which was not onely (as I haue said) to couer our nakednesse and hide our filthinesse; but also to
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:10731:226"/> preserue our bodies from the iniuries of the weather, wee shall find little cause which may moue vs to affect or delight our selues in this superfluous brauerie. For this emnitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs and the creatures which makes vs neede these ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of defence, puts vs in mind of the cause thereof, which was our emnitie with God by reason of our sinne: these co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers to hide vs, argue to our shame, that there is something vnder them which needes couering; and these plaisters, though they be of silke or veluet, shew that vnder them are some loathsome sores, which being seene would disgrace and shame vs. In all which respects the most glorious gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments bring with them cause of blushing rather then of boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting; for before man sinned hee was glorious in his naturall beautie; and a garment to him would haue beene but as a cloud to the sunne, which doth not grace it but hide his brightnesse. Neither would these ornaments haue more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned him then a silken case a sweete rose; but when his beautie was by sinne blemished, then, like the withered rose reserued in a bag of silke, hee was driuen to seeke for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to supplie naturall defects with the helpe of art. So that he who is proud of these poore supplies, is like vnto him who being blind glorieth in siluer eyes; or vnto a lame man, who hauing lost his legge, boasteth and braggeth of a gilded stumpe, which was not giuen him for glory and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation, but as a poore support to hold him vp, and as a sorrie helpe to relieue his miserie. And this the Lord plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimated in those first garments which he gaue our great progenitours; for howsoeuer hee could as easilie haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided apparell of silke, or veluet, curiously imbroydered with gold and siluer, as of any meaner stuffes; yet he clothed them with beasts skins, which were onely fit for those vses of hiding their nakednesse, and defending them from the weather, and serued rather to humble then to puffe them vp with pride, not only by putting thē in mind of their brutish condition, but also of their frailety and mortality, seeing the creatures for their sakes were already subiect to death and vanity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let vs consider, that howsoeuer it may be seeme<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 10. That excessiue brauarie in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell mis bescemeth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi>

                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:10731:227"/> worldlings to iet it out daily in their gorgeous attire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue nothing to glorie in but these outward things; and also haue their proud habits suiting with their proud hearts, and the rest of their outward cariage and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, yet it much misbeseemeth christians herein to fashion themselues to the custome of the world; for their chiefe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments are not outward and carnall, but inward and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, when as they are decked with Gods sanctifying gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; they are most glorious when they are most humble, and what hath humility to doe with the ensignes of pride? they are best adorned with modestie and chastity, which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly shew themselues in sober and graue attire; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what haue they to doe with phantasticall fashions, and the wanton and light habits of lasciuious and filthie harlots? they come nearest the truth of their profession, when as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the rule of the Scriptures, they put on the <hi>habit of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 3. 1. Tim. 2. 9. 10.</note>

Why will christian women seeme such as they would bee loth to be; and hauing nothing to sell, why do they hang out signes to inuite customers? Finally, seeing in our Baptisme we haue renounced the world with the vanities and lusts thereof, why should we in our apparell shew our selues as vaine as the vainest, or hauing cast these lusts out of our hearts, as it were the chiefe city, why doe wee suffer them to rest vpon our backes, as in the suburbs, where they are ready euery day to make a reentrie, and to bring with them all vice and vanitie? Againe, let vs remember, that if our Sauiour Christ would not haue vs, who professe our selues children of our heauenly father, to take any care for food and raiment, but to rest our selues vpon his alsufficient prouidence; how much lesse would hee haue vs to trouble our braines about curious and costly ornaments? how farre would hee haue vs from
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:10731:227"/> spending our time &amp; study about variety of colours, in broy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery, iewels, dying and curling of haire, painting, periwigs, and such like vanities? Finally, seeing we professe our selues pilgrims on earth; why should we goe like, not onely citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, but courtiers of the world? and seeing we say that wee are trauelling towards our heauenly countrie; why doe wee loade not so much our bodies, as our minds, with the intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable waight and heauie care of variety and superfluity of suits, made more massie and burthensome with gold, siluer, and precious iewels; all which before wee come to our iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies end, we must leaue behind vs, if at least we do not make the poore our porters to beare them for vs.</p>

Againe, what excellencie or worth is there in the richest silkes, and finest clothes, the matter of the one being the excrement of crawling wormes, the other the fleece of the sillie sheepe? both which within a short time weare out to ragges, or with vntimely decay may bee consumed with moathes and sillie vermine; and what excellencie is in that, which as wormes breed, so wormes destroy? And of what worth is that to be valued which man borroweth from beastes and creeping things, which are creatures farre inferiour vnto himselfe? A noble man much scorneth to borrow clothes of a meane yeoman; or being by present need constrained to bee thus beholding, he would rather be ashamed then glorie in it; although these both are creatures of the same kind, made by
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:10731:228"/> the same workeman, and cast out of the same mold, and yet man borroweth ornaments from all the inferiour creatures; from one his fleece, from another his skinne, from this his light feathers, from that his teeth and solid bones, from wormes their intrailes, from cats their excrements, from the sands his stones, from the earth his gold; and when with the crow he hath made himselfe gay with these borrowed fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he glorieth and vaunteth himselfe in his owne worth, as though they grew all vpon his owne backe; and that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and not art, had put this difference between him and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

So that vicious men haue little cause to glorie in this externall and strange beautie, when they haue lost their owne, the inward vertues of the mind. As therefore no man iudgeth a horse the better which is set out to sale, because hee hath a veluet footcloth, or golden trappings, yea rather suspecting this brauerie, he vncouereth him of them al, and looketh vpon him in his naturall beauty: so neither is a man to be esteemed better for his glorious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, but laying these aside, wee are to value him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the inward beautie of his mind; for if that which is outwardly seene of man, is not man, but the soule, vnto which his body is but the case or couer; how much lesse are we to esteeme gay apparell any part of mans excellencie and goodnes, seeing it is but a meere accident, which may easily be put on, and with more ease laid aside?</p>

Paedag. lib. 3. cap. 11.</note> that this glorious apparell doth not aduance those ends
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:10731:229"/> for which it is vsed: for first, whereas it is put on as an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to commend vs, it is manifest that it faileth herein; for (as one saith) he who thinks that gold adornes him, must acknowledge himselfe inferiour to that whereby he is ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and being inferiour, hee is no more a master of it but a seruant: now what is more absurd then for a man to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge himselfe inferiour, and lesse comely and beautifull then this Lydian fragment? Neither in truth doth this gay clothing adorne and commend any in respect of their state and person, bodie or mind, if it be excessiue in it selfe, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate and too too common in respect of time; for if a man thus goe aboue his calling, in stead of making himselfe commendable by all his cost and labour, hee is of some enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of others skorned; one hee prouoketh to anger, another to laughter, and all to displeasure and dislike; yea those who bow vnto those thus richly adorned and do them reuerence, euen in the performance of these outward complements, doe secretly condemne them in their hearts; censuring them of pride, vanitie and wantonnesse; seeing if they were not wholly possessed of these vices, they would not with so great cost and labour attire themselues aboue their calling, nor with such phantasticall and light fashions deforme their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Wherein the iust iudgement of God threatned against the proud lieth heauilie vpon them; for when they thinke by their cost and brauerie to exalt themselues in euery ones iudgement, and to be commended and approued of all that behold them, the Lord resisting them in their pride, pulleth them downe, and maketh them to please none, whereas they intended hereby to please all, for God approueth them not, yea rather he professeth to oppose against them; the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and humble like them not, for hating pride in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, they cannot loue it in others: those who are as proud as themselues are not hereby pleased; for they who are their superiours disdaine that they should match or come neere them in brauerie; their equals emulate and contend with them who shall exceed other; their inferiours enuie and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne them because they cannot be as fine as they, yea them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues are not pleased with themselues, because they neuer
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:10731:229"/> thinke that they are braue enough, which is the reason that they so often alter their attires and change their fashions, because none can long please them, and giue contentment. In a word, they please no bodie with their brauerie, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the prince of pride, whose subiects and seruants they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse themselues by wearing his badge and liuerie. So that if a man would honest and commend himselfe to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all; it were a much wiser course to fit his apparell according to his place and calling, yea to carrie a lower sale then the ship may well beare, abating somewhat of that brauerie which his estate may well warrant and maintaine; for heere also we shall find it most true, that he who exalteth himselfe shall be cast downe, and he who humbleth himselfe shall bee exalted; euerie one being readie to adde vnto his praise, who rather shunneth then seeketh it; and to detract from him, who too much affecteth and eagerlie pursueth credit and commendations.</p>
               <p>And as this costly and gorgeous apparell doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 15. That this bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie graceth neither the beautifull nor deformed, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</hi>
                  </note> the person or state of any; so neither doth it make their body or mind more commendable, whether they bee beautifull or deformed, indued with rare vertues, or defiled with foule vices. For if they bee beautifull by nature, what neede they the helpe of art, seeing nature it selfe sufficeth? especially seeing these goodly ornaments doe not commend them so much to the sight, as they detract from their praise in the iudgement; euery one being ready to attribute a great share of their beautie and comelinesse, to their setting forth and gainesse in apparell, imagining that almost any other would be as praise worthie as they, if they were so decked<note place="margin">

In which regard a carelesse neglect of beautie better pleaseth; and oftentimes not to be adorned is in stead of the best ornament. Againe, this brauerie as little helpeth those who naturally are deformed, seeing it doth not take away their deformities but rather sheweth them, when as it inuiteth the eyes of all to behold them, and so causeth them to thinke in their iudgements, that so great cost is but ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed. Neither doth it at al profit the mind of man, whether he be indued with vertue, or blemished with vice; for if the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:10731:230"/> glorious beames of vertue doe shine in any, the brightnesse thereof so much excelleth these outward ornaments, that they adde no more grace to a man, then a candle light when the sunne shineth. Contrariwise if the mind bee destitute of vertue, and deformed with vice; this outward decking will little auaile to furnish it with the one, or cleanse it from the other. It will not make any more religious, humble, iust, and temperate; yea rather as experience sheweth, it bringeth men to the contrary extreames, it doth not abate pride and vaine glory, yea rather it encreaseth it; it doth not extinguish the heate of lust, but rather doth inflame it; it doth not warm our hearts with charity, nor repell the force of the diuels darts, but causeth rather our loue to freese, and endangereth vs to Satans blowes; it doth not free vs from iniustice, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging anger, enuie, malice, intemperance, couetousnesse, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and such like vices, but rather giueth occasion and way vnto them. In which respect a vicious man adorned with<note place="margin">

So that rich attire neither beautifieth nor bettereth either the body or the mind; and therefore those who being destitute of vertue, or of naturall beautie doe thinke to adorne and commend themselues by their goodly apparell, fall into the errour of the painters boy, who being to paint the faire <hi>Helen,</hi> and wanting art to set forth her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">Clemens Alex. paedagog. lib. 2. cap. 12.</note> daubed on gold on her apparell, making her clothes rich, because he could not make her face beautifull.</p>
               <p>Secondly, worldlings vse these rich ornaments because<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 16. That costly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell doth not make those that weare it more respected.</hi>
                  </note> they would be more admired and respected; the which end also is often frustrate, especially when as by often vse they are made ordinarie; for gold and siluer, silkes and veluets, being as common as stuffes, cloth, and freese, are within a while as little regarded and admired; yea though man could match the sunne in glory, yet if with the sunne they should daily appeare in this brauerie, it would worke in the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders no wonder or respect, howsoeuer at the first sight they
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:10731:230"/> were much admired; yea contrariwise because they wast their states, and spend all their liuings in maintaining this brauery, and superfluous excesse, which was heretofore bestowed, vpon charitable vses and good hospitality; therefore the meaner and poorer sort, receiuing no reliefe or comfort from them; detest their pride and enuie their brauerie. Much wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser therefore was the course held by our forefathers, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing indeed costly attire befitting their callings, did not weare it commonly, but by the seldome vse thereof, made it the more to be admired and respected, and howsoeuer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their garments of the best and most lasting stuffes, they did not need to change them, but wore the same clothes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeeres together; yet wearing them so seldome, and with such great distance of time comming betweene; and not glutting either themselues or others with their common vse, it was all one, as if at euery good time they had changed their suit and fashion. By which wise frugality they were enabled to keepe good hospitalitie, and to performe the workes of mercy; whereby as they had comfort to their owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; so did they deserue the loue and reuerence of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours towards them, when as they tasted of their bountie and goodnes. Especially they were not driuen through their excessiue expences to inhance rents and increase fines, but hauing sufficient of their owne to maintaine their port, they were able to afford to their poore tenants their houses and lands at such easie rates, as they might comfortablie liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their shelter. Whereby as their loines did blesse them, when they enioyed these benefits from them; so in the time of peace they had so many seruants as tenants, readie for all imployments; and in time of warre so many souldiers, who in all dangers were ready to liue and die with them. Whereas now their pride hauing set rents and fines vpon the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest racke, because nothing sufficeth to maintaine their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue brauerie, and hauing turned hospitality and the works of mercy into richiewels, sumptuous furniture, and gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apparell; their tenants stand vpon equall tearmes with them, seeing their houses and lands being brought to the markethil, they had onely a bare penniworth for their pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie;
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:10731:231"/> and therefore at their need are vnwilling (vnlesse they be forced by oppression) to do them any seruice, or to stand betweene them and any danger; so that whereas heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gentlemen so imployed their wealth, that it serued notablie for their defence in time of perill; now spending it vpon iewels, apparell, plate and furniture, in time of peace it exposeth them to enuie, and the danger of theeues, and in time of warre to the common spoyle.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I shewed the vnprofitablenesse of costly<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 17. Of the euils which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie excessiue brauerie: sinne against God.</hi>
                  </note> and gay apparell: which if it bee not sufficient to weane our hearts from it, let vs further consider that it is not onely emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of profit, but also full of euill, both in respect of sinne and punishment; for it is euery way sinfull as being sin in it selfe, the cause and also the effect of sinne. Concerning the first, they who exceed in this excessiue brauery offend first against the maiesty of God himselfe, not onely by transgressing his commandement, whereby he hath forbidden it, and by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting his worship and seruice, because their whole time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most is taken vp either in caring for, prouiding, or putting on their ornaments; and thereby either want time on Gods sabbaths to come to his publicke seruice, or else rush into his presence without all due preparation; but also through the grosse abuse of his creatures and good blessings besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vpon them. For they were not made stewards of these rich talents, that they should bestow them in excesse and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: but that with the surplussage of their wealth they should relieue their poore brethren, and performe the works of charitie and mercy, which either respect the good of the Church or common-wealth. And therefore fearefull will their account bee at the day of iudgement; when as it will not excuse their neglecting the poore members of Christ, to say they could spare nothing from these vses, because all was too little to maintaine their brauerie and excessiue cost in apparell; nor yet that their riches and reuenues was great, and therefore they might well adorne themselues in gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attire; seeing their wealth was not giuen them, that they should wast it in superfluities, but that they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow it in relieuing the poores necessities, in which respect
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:10731:231"/> this excuse of abundance will bee no better, then if a man should cause his garments to bee made farre too large and long for his stature, and excuse himselfe by this, that hee had too much stuffe: for as it is absurd and ridiculous, to make the garment not after the measure of the body, but the quantitie of the peece out of which it is cut: so is it no lesse absurd to wast a mans substance in such costly apparell, as is aboue his calling, and not fitting to his state and condition, because he hath abundance of wealth lying by him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, heerein they sinne against themselues: first, by<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 18. Too much care in decking the body, argueth the neglect of the soule.</hi>
                  </note> neglecting their soule, which is their most excellent part, whilest their whole care and paines is taken vp in adorning of their bodies; for too much care of the bodie plainely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth, the too little care of the soule; richnes in apparell, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie in vertue; outward ornaments, inward deformities,<note place="margin">

In which respect they are not vnfitly compared to beeres or coffins; for as they are most adorned, when as they haue a dead bodie in them; so these bodies are most decked with gorgeous attire, when they haue in them a soule desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of vertue and dead in sinne. And in the same regard one of the ancients compareth them to the stately temples of Egypt, which had the outward courts, porches, walles and<note place="margin">Clemens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexand. paedag. lib. 3. cap. 2.</note> roofes, richly adorned with gold, siluer, curious caruing and ingrauing, and with all other stately and gorgeous orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but if a man should goe on further into the inmost parts, to see the idoll which was there worshipped, in stead of some goodly image set out according to the rest of the brauerie and pompe; hee should find nothing but the base picture, or other resemblance of some cat, crocodile or vgly serpent: for so these women who load themselues with gold, siluer, iewels, and costly apparell, if this outward glory bee remoued, and they more narrowly searched what they haue in the inmost temple of their heart, they cannot shew vnto vs Gods image shining in his spirituall graces, but rather a
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:10731:232"/> man shall find in them crocodiles and serpents, that is, beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lusts, pride, wantonnesse, immodesty, and such like impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Againe, those who affect this costly apparell hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, whilest by their pride and excessiue brauerie they lie open to the hatred and enuie, the censers and bitter frumps of all that see them. For euen those who are sober, graue and humble, when they see those who are inferiour vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in place and calling, so farre outstrip them in this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward brauerie, cannot chuse but disdaine and scorne it; and others who thinke themselues as good as they, comming short of them for want of meanes, or will, so to bestow their cost, doe as much enuie and hate them. The which sheweth the extreame follie of these proud persons; for whereas they might haue loue and due respect among their neighbours good cheape, they rather chuse to purchase hatred, enuie, and contempt, at these deare rates. Finally, by this outward brauerie they disgrace themselues, and bewray vnto euery iudicious beholder the secret corruptions which lie lurking in their hearts. For when the heart is infected and poysoned with the contagious plague of pride, it tainteth outwardly the whole body with the markes and tokens, which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prognosticate death and destruction, without repentance. So if it be corrupted with follie, it discouereth it selfe in foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and phantasticall fashions; if with prodigall vanity, it appeareth in the outward superfluitie; if with lust, it sheweth it selfe in a wanton habit: and finally, if it bee an heart soft and effeminate, it will easily bee discerned, by soft raiment<note place="margin">

Againe, they are scandalous to those who are without, as they hinder and discourage them by their pride and excesse from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing and professing of their religion, when as in this they can perceiue no difference between a professour of religion, and a professed vaine person; the children of God, and the children of the diuell; those who professe mortification, and they who are worldly and prophane.

Finally, if in sincerity of heart wee professe and practise christianity, and yet bee ouertaken with this vanity, as we doe thereby wrong our selues by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing our good name; so by seeming that we are not, wee giue occasion to wicked worldlings of falling into sinne, whilest for this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="400" facs="tcp:10731:234"/> deare vnto them, by not setting themselues forth in such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell as best pleaseth them. To which I answere, that if any haue such husbands, delighted with follie and vanity, their wiues haue in this kind greater liberty then other women, because smaller inconueniences are to bee vndergone, that greater may be auoided: but let such vnder colour of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie beware of licentiousnesse, and vnder shew of pleasing their husbands, let them take heed that they doe not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please God, wound their owne consciences, and offend their brethren, by wearing such costly or garish apparell, as is either aboue their particular state and calling; or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming their generall calling of christianity. For howsoeuer they ought to please their husbands rather then strangers, yet they must labour more to please God thē them both, yea euen strangers too in that which is good, rather then their husbands in that which is wicked and vnlawfull. But further I admonish them to take heed lest this bee a meere pretence and false excuse, and that they doe not by this brauerie study to please their husbands, but rather their own proud humor, yea euen strangers themselues, whilest they affect by this bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie their esteeme and commendations. For if they angled onely for their husbands loue, they would cast this baite of brauerie before his eyes alone, more carefully adorning themselues at home whilest they are in his presence, then when they goe abrode into other companie: whereas they follow the contrarie practise, curiously decking themselues when they are to goe forth into the companie of strangers, and putting all off againe when they come home and returne vnto their husbands. Finally, let such know that if at all they are constrained to seeke to please them by these vaine orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is for the most part for want of better things, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they should be commended. For if in their behauiour and conuersation they were religious, wise, modest, graue and sober, and towards their husbands meeke, humble, louing, and respectiue, they would by these vertues and duties please them better, if they haue any religion, conscience, or true wisedome, then by wearing the gayest ornaments; or if they be yet strangers to the grace of God, they may through his
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:10731:234"/> blessing winne them (as the Apostle telleth vs) to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 1.</note> and practise of religion, by this their holy and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conuersation.</p>
               <p>And thus it appeareth that the wearing of costly and gay<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 22. That excessiue brauerie is the cause of many sinnes, in respect of those that weare it.</hi>
                  </note> apparell, vnfitting our state and calling, is it selfe a sinne. It followeth that I also shew that it is both the cause and effect of other sinnes much greater then it selfe. And first, it is the cause of many sins, which men vsually commit, both against themselues, and against their neighbours, in both which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards this excessiue brauerie is a fruitfull mother of much wickednesse. It is the cause of lust and vncleannesse both in themselues that weare it, as it doth effeminate the mind and softeneth the heart, making it vaine and wanton, and so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to receiue any impression of lust; as also in others, as it<note place="margin">

It is also the cause of much pride; for as pride first breedeth brauerie, so no sooner is it borne, but presently it nourisheth the mother that bred it, making men in these gay habits to thinke better of themselues then when they are more meanely attired, and to contemne others as base, who are not decked in such rich attire. It causeth men, and much more women to misspend their time, whilest they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume a great part of their life, either in casting with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues how they may be most braue, and what fashion will best become them; or in putting their purposes in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whilest they spend the greatest part of the morning in prancking aad trimming of their bodies; or finally, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuing their plots, and vsing the meanes for the vpholding and maintaining of their excesse. Whereby it commeth to passe, that they haue little or no time to adorne their soules with Gods sauing graces, knowledge, faith, charity and the rest, but remaine ignorant, impenitent, secure, and full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity; neither yet to performe the publicke duties of Gods seruice, nor their owne priuate deuotions, (for they dresse themselues by the houre, and pray by minuts) nor finally the duties of their particular callings in their houses and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:10731:235"/> For whereas the calling of the womankind tieth them to keepe the chiefe part of their residence at home, imitating the snaile which carieth her house vpon her backe; contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise hauing spent a great part of the day in dressing of themselues in their rich and costly attire, they haue now no power to stay at home, but needs they must goe abrode to shew their brauerie, as thinking their costly apparell and vaine fashions not worth the wearing, vnlesse they might be seene often, and much admired. And to say truth, such are as well abrode as at home, seeing by their habit they haue made themselues vnfit for any huswifely dutie; for neither may they come neere those places which require their chiefe residence, for soiling of their clothes, neither are they able to stirre themselues more then images, for the performing of any businesse. Yea to that height of pride is the world come, that euerie pettie gentlewoman skorneth to be seene in any such husewifelie imployments, whereas in ancient times,<note place="margin">Pro. 31.</note> princes and queenes thought it their chiefe glory, as we may see in the example of <hi>Salomons</hi> mother.</p>
               <p>And as this pride of apparell is a cause of much sinne in<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 23. That this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse causeth many euils both to priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and to the common-wealth.</hi>
                  </note> respect of themselues that vse it; so also in regard of others, whether we respect priuate persons or the whole common-wealth. For what greater cause I pray you is there of bribing and extorsion, fraud and cousonage, oppressing of the poore by cruell landlords, whilest vnmeasurablie they encrease their fines and inhance their rents, yea of wrongs and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, rapine and violence, theft and sacriledge, then this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in costly apparel, men being resolued to run any desperat and wicked course, rather then they will want meanes to maintain this pride. Neither doth this exces in apparel bring lesse mischiefe to the whole common-wealth then to priuat persons. For first, it ouerthroweth all order of ciuill societie, whilest there is in the outward habit no distinction of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; but the superiour and inferiour, the master and the seruant, the maid and mistrisse, the nobleman and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the gentleman and farmer goe all alike; so as by the outward habite they cannot possiblie bee discerned the one from the other. Againe, it is the chiefe cause of the decay
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:10731:235"/> of good hospitalitie, which is a principall pillar that vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the common-wealth, as being the meanes to preserue loue and neighbourly friendship among the richer sort, and to giue reliefe to the poore, who stand in need of helpe. For whereas there was much bestowed this way by our ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, whilest they contented themselues with meane attire; now they who succeed them, although they haue doubled and redoubled their fines and rents, cannot keepe open doores, but are faine to leaue their countries, and to lurke in corners of great cities to saue charges in housekeeping, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able with all their meanes to maintaine halfe their forefathers familie, because all which they can rake and scrape together, is much too little to maintain their brauery in apparell. Finally, there is no cause equall to this, of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerishing the common-wealth, of causing dearth and scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of all things necessarie; and consequently of bringing the whole communaltie to want and miserie. For to maintaine this excesse in apparell, landlords are faine to rack their rents; and the tenant being not able with all his labor poorely to maintaine his charge, and pay his rent, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to raise the prices of all his countrie commodities to a double rate. Artificers and tradesmen are likewise for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to increase the prices of their worke and wares, being not otherwise able to maintaine their families; and none smart so much as the poorer sort, who being destitute of meanes, haue no entercourse of dealing with the rest, nor cannot (like the other) heale their owne wound by biting of their fellow; or being not able hauing done their worke to forbeare the sale, are for the sustaining of their present ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie faine to part with their wares at such easie rates as the buiers please to giue them. Finally, nothing doth more impouerish the common-wealth then this excessiue braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, seeing our monies and chiefe commodities, which are of much better vse, are daily transported into other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, we hauing in lieu thereof nothing but costly stuffes, silkes and veluets, gold and siluer laces, and such like toyes and vanities, which within a few moneths wearing come to ragges, not worth the taking vp if a man should find them in
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:10731:236"/> the streets. In which respect this pride of apparell endama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the land more then any other wastfull expences; for howsoeuer much cost is superfluously bestowed on sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous buildings, plate, and excesse in diet; yet here the riches of the common-wealth continue still amongst vs, and do but onely change their master, and that commonly a richer for a poorer: whereas this apparell is the cause why our chiefe riches and treasures are vsually transported into other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and in the meane time our owne commodities are vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and lightly esteemed, and the poore people want im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, or at least a sufficient reward for their great labor. To say nothing of the durable continuance of houses and plate: whereas these gay clothes euery yeer, yea (in our times) almost euery quarter, must be new either in themselues, or at least in their fashion, &amp; so bring a continual &amp; heauie charge to all that vse them. In which regard though religion &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science should not preuaile with vs; yet mee thinks ciuill po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, and loue of our countrie and common welfare, should perswade vs to loath and lay aside this pride and brauerie.</p>
               <p>And thus it appeareth that this rich and costly attire is the cause of many euils. Now to the end that wee may plainely<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 24. That costly and vaine apparell is the fruit of pride and selfe-loue.</hi>
                  </note> see, that it hath neere alliance to all kinds of wickednesse, we are further to consider that it is also the effect and fruit of sinne, namely, of pride and selfe-loue, which worke in men a desire to seeme excellent, and in all things to exceed other men; howsoeuer oftentimes they faile of their end, for as much as others being as proud as they, vie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with them for this preheminence. Neuerthelesse though they misse the marke, yet doe they continually aime and shoote at it, propounding this as the maine end of all their brauerie and excessiue cost, that they may excell and put downe others. And thus some adorne themselues that they may seeme more beautifull; some that they may bee thought more noble and better descended, &amp; some that they may be reputed more wealthy, &amp; of better estate then the rest of their neighbors. And as heereby they labour to aduance themselues into the highest seate of mens hearts, and seeke to be greatly esteemed, and much admired of al that looke vpon
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:10731:236"/> them; so by the same meanes they aspire to haue the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence before others, the vpper hand and highest places in<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 2. 3. <hi>Vestitus insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis ac mollis su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbiae vexil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum est, nidus{que} luxuriae.</hi> Aug.

So that this gay apparell is (as one truely calleth it) the verie ensigne of pride, and nest of luxurie; for take away beholders and admirers, priority in estimation and prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in place, and there would need no statute of restraint to prohibit this excesse.</p>
               <p>Finally, as this excessiue brauerie in apparell is euery way euill in respect of sinne; so also it is euill in regard of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for first, thereby the mind is exceedingly molested and troubled, not onely in inuenting fashions, and in studying how the body may be most beautified and adorned; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in laying plots and contriuing meanes to maintaine this brauerie. For men bestowing excessiue cost aboue their meanes about this vanity, are forced to run into debt which is the very bane of a quiet mind, and to borrow moneys vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vsurie, or to take vp their stuffes at worse rates, which by reason of the increase of the price, and decrease of their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, they are commonly worse able to repay at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, then when they tooke it vpon credit; and therefore they are forced to trie &amp; tire al their friends, to change often their creditours, borrowing of one to pay vnto another, to receiue proud repulses, euen of those whose lending is their liuing; to endure vpon euery default of payment hard words, and bitter menacings; yea oftentimes suites, arrests, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, and many such like miseries: for as the wise man<note place="margin">Pro. 22. 7.</note> saith, those that borrow lose their liberty, and become thrals and vassals to those who lend vnto them. By all which cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses not onely the mind is exceedingly tormented, as being continually vpon the racke of passion; reioycing when they haue borrowed, sorrowing when they are to pay, fretting when they receiue repulses and disgraces, and fearing when as through default of payment they haue hazarded their

When as being pinched with want &amp; misery, they are glad of cloth &amp; freese, who before skorned silks and veluets, vnles they were cut and mangled, printed, and laced, as best fitted their vaine fantasie: and to become loathsome &amp; vnwelcom guests at other mens tables; who, before pride had shut them out of their owne houses, were able to giue liberall intertainement vnto others.

                  </note> the speciall kinds thereof. Now it followeth in the last place that we examine worldly pleasures, to see if wee can find any more worth and excellencie in them, then in the other: where vpon the triall we shall find, that howsoeuer they may be preferred before honours and riches, as being the end of them both: for therefore do men affect honors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they delight and please them, and riches because they would enioy them, and reioyce in their fruition, as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are much more free from trouble, and full of sweetnesse; whereof it is that the wise <hi>Salomon,</hi> who had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of them all, concludeth, that among worldly things <hi>there is nothing better, then that a man should reioyce in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,</hi>

                  <hi>because that is his portion:</hi> and that there <hi>is no profit to man, but that he eate and drinke, and delight his soule with the profit of his labour:</hi> yet neuerthelesse if we compare them with the spirituall ioy of a Christian in this life, or the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly ioyes in the life to come, they are to be esteemed vaine and of no value, and to be contemned as being altogether worthlesse and void of excellencie. For howsoeuer <hi>Salomon</hi> comparing them with other worldly things, doth giue them the preeminence; yet considering them in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ioyned with our vse, he condemneth them as vaine and vnprofitable, in respect of any sound good, or true happines which they bring vnto vs. <hi>I said in my heart</hi> (saith he) <hi>go to</hi>

                  <hi>now, I will proue thee with ioy, therfore take thou pleasure in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant things: and behold this also is vanitie. I said of laughter, thou art mad: and of ioy, what is that thou doest?</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he saith, that he sought for ioy and contentment, in stately buildings, fruitfull vineyards, pleasant gardens and orchards, sweete and delightfull musicke, and in all other worldly pleasures which his heart could thinke of; but in
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:10731:238"/> conclusion found, that there was nothing in them all, but meere vanitie, and which is worse, vexation of spirit.</p>
               <p>But how vaine and void of excellencie these worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. That worldly pleasures are gifts of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour nature, which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed most plentifully vpon the wicked.</hi>
                  </note> are, it may hereby appeare, in that if we take them at the best, they are but of a meane, inferiour and indifferent nature; whose goodnes chiefly consisteth in their mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and measure, rather then in the pleasures themselues; which measure being exceeded, they become euil and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, as we may see in the exceesse of eating, drinking, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the rest. Now how base and meane is that good to be esteemed, whose abstemious vse is better then full fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? and whose limites measure is more commendable, then plentie and abundance? yea how void of excellencie, and neare vnto nought is that to be accounted, which becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth euill by increasing, and when it hath greatnesse, loseth goodnes? And hence it is, that the Lord, whose most wise iudgement is the true ballance, that discerneth solid good, from light vanitie, esteeming these worldly pleasures, as vaine and worthlesse trifles, carelessely casteth them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among all, and suffereth the bad as well as the good, his enemies as well as his friends to communicate in them: yea seeing that the wicked set their hearts vpon them, and loue them much better then their Creator; and his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, being too carnally licorous, are readie to surfet vpon these sweet meats of worldly delights; hauing scattered them in common among all, in his iust iudgement to the one, he leaueth them to their owne libertie, and letteth them ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their fill; and in his rich mercie to the other, he holdeth them backe, when they run after them with too eager an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and suffereth them to feed vpon them but sparingly, and in small quantitie, and because being tainted with the fall of our first parents, as they still retaine some goodnes of their creation, so there is infused into them a malignant qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, which filleth those who too much feed vpon them, with the grosse and dangerous humors of corruption: therefore the Lord the wise Physition, either restraineth his patients, whom he intendeth to cure, from their vse, or if yeelding so much to their appetite, he suffereth them to feed vpon them;
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:10731:239"/> he doth so correct and qualifie them with the cordiall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatiues of his grace, that they do not hurt them; or if the grosse humors of sin breed in them by this voluptuous diet, he purgeth them away with the bitter potions of troubles and afflictions. So that the wicked haue a greater portion in these worldly delights then Gods dearest children; yea and much more carnall pleasure in their fruition, because in the securitie of their hearts they inioy them, letting the raines loose to their licentious will, and suffering their appetites to take their fill, vntill euen they glut themselues with these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and be made drunke with abundance of pleasure: whereas the children of God dare only taste of these bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching cups, or if being allured with the sweetnes, they take a more deepe draught, they find them bitter in digestion, for not only do they find much trouble in the very fruition of their pleasures, whilest they are faine to watch with great care and vigilancie ouer their hearts, that they do not surfet of these delights, by exceeding iust measure, lest in pleasing themselues they displease God; but finding that they are faultie and ouertaken, they haue their sweet pleasures sowre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sauced, with present smiting of the heart, and checkes of conscience, and afterwards when the delight is vanished, it leaueth behind it bitter sorrow and repentance: whereby it appeareth that the children of the world haue in al respects a greater share in these carnall pleasures, then the children of God: and therefore our Sauiour Christ plainly telleth his Disciples, that <hi>they should weepe and lament, when as wicked</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 16. 20.</note>
                  <hi>worldlings should reioyce,</hi> and solace themselues in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights: the which also the experience of all times hath plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proued: for <hi>Dauid</hi> was afflicted and persecuted, when his wicked enemies wallowed in their delights, and through their daintie fare, ease and pleasure, had their eyes swollen with fatnesse; so the false Prophets fare daintily at <hi>Iesabels</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalme 73.</note> table, whilest poore <hi>Elias</hi> is fed by the rauens, and glad of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny scraps: proud <hi>Herod</hi> delighteth himselfe with his feasts and reuels, whilest holy <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> lieth in prison, expecting death; and the rich Glutton goeth gorgeously and fareth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously euery day, whilest poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> is couered with
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:10731:239"/> sores in stead of clothes; and being famished with hunger cannot haue the crummes of his table, or the least part of his needlesse superfluities. By all which it appeareth that these worldly pleasures are of little worth, seeing the Lord doth so plentifully bestow them vpon those who are most vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie; and that they haue little goodnesse in them; because with a sparing hand he imparteth them vnto the good, and suffereth those who are voide of goodnesse to bee glutted with them.</p>
               <p>But how vaine and worthlesse these worldly pleasures are,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. That the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish creatures haue the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest share in earthly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</hi>
                  </note> it may further appeare, in that the Lord more freely, and in greater measure bestoweth them vpon the brutish creatures, then vpon those who are reasonable; implying thereby that they are so base and contemptible, that they are fitter for beasts then for men. And this may easily appeare, if wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that the bruit creatures haue full freedome in the vse of their delights, hauing no law to limit them but their owne appetite, and consequently are priuiledged in their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures from all sinne, guilt and punishment; whereas man is limited by the law, so as he dare not do what hee list, but is pulled backe with feare when his appetite most draweth him on, being subiect to punishment when in his delights he exceedeth due measure. Or if he desperately goe on, hee hath all his mirth marred with the pangs of an accusing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and loseth much of his present delight, through feare and expectation of future punishment. Againe, they are so guided by instinct of nature, and haue their appetite so fully conformable to it direction, that they take delight in those pleasures, which are vnto them most good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; they ioy in that food which is most fit for their nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, and take pleasure in no more then will do them good; they satisfie in seasonable time their naturall lusts, and enioy their sports when it best pleaseth them; they doe not compasse their pleasures by fraud or iniurie offered to those of their owne kind, nor enioy them enuying, or being enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; their pleasures are free from shame, because they are free from sin, and haue not like men their delights damped with lookers on. They haue more strength and health then
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:10731:240"/> men to enioy their pleasures, and their appetite is no more strong to desire these sweete delights then their stomacke to digest them; they haue no crudities in concoction nor su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie of ill humours through bad digestion; or if they haue, they can easily cure themselues with their knowne physicke, and neuer need the apothecaries lothsome drugs. Finally, they securely enioy their pleasures without feare of losing them; and when the obiect of their delight is taken away, they haue no ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>king care in seeking it, or griefe for losing it. By all which it appeareth that the brutish crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures haue many priuiledges in their pleasures more then men; and therefore farre be it from vs to set our hearts vpon these vanities, as though they were of great worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, seeing the very beasts herein excell and goe before vs: for (as one saith) if this were mans chiefe good to enioy pleasures, in vaine was reason and wisedome bestowed vpon him, seeing he might more easily and perfectly attaine vnto<note place="margin">Cleanthes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Stobaeum Serm. 6. §. <hi>Sect. 4. That worldly pleasures are of lesse esteeme because they are apt to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused.</hi>
                  </note> and enioy them, if he had onely the guide of sense and son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall appetite, like the brutish creatures.</p>
               <p>Lastly, howsoeuer these worldly pleasures be vaine and worthlesse in themselues, yet they become more base and of lesse value, by reason that we are ready through our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to abuse them vnto sinne; being apt in the middest of our delights to forget God, and neglect his seruice, to vse prophane iesting, and wanton communication, intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and excesse; and finally to remaine in our security and hardnesse of heart, putting farre from vs the euill day, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it our repentance and conuersion vnto God: In which regard the wise <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, that it is <hi>better to goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the house of mourning then into the house of feasting; because this is the end of all men: and the liuing shall lay it to his heart: and that anger is better then laughter, because by a sad looke the heart is made better; and finally, that it is a signe of a wise heart, when it frequenteth the house of mourners, and a badge of follie, when it moueth vs to haunt the house of mirth.</hi> But of this I shall haue occasion hereafter to speake more largely; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the vncertaintie, inutility, and hurtfulnesse of worldly pleasures, all which proue them most vaine and worthlesse;
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:10731:240"/> and therefore it shall suffice in this place to haue thus briefly touched them.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore these carnall delights are so vaine and<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 5. That the vanity of worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures should make vs to seek spirituall and heauenly ioyes.</hi>
                  </note> void of excellencie, let vs not like filthie swine, take our chiefe ioy and contentment to wallow our selues in this pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of worldly pleasures: neither let vs like the serpentine brood creepe groueling vpon our bellies, licking the dust of these earthly and sensuall delights; but rather let vs seeke while we continue heere, to take our chiefe delight in the Lord, in meditating and studying in his word, in doing his will, in our reconciliation and peace with God, in our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ioy, grounded vpon our assurance and hopeful expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our heauenly happinesse; and finally in all other Gods spirituall fauours and graces. For if the heathen man iustly taxed such of folly as did seeke for pleasure in tauernes, rather<note place="margin">Zeno apud Stobaeum.</note> then in their owne houses; and in vnlawfull sports, rather then in their honest labours; how much more are we to bee reproued, if we seeke for our ioy and delight in voluptuous, carnall, and sinfull pleasures, which being vaine and momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tante, doe end in bitternesse, and eternall woe and miserie, and not in Gods loue, holy obedience, and all other testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his mercy, and pledges of our owne saluation? In which (if our hearts were not too too carnall, sauouring on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly earthly things, and our negligence exceeding great, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a holy and comfortable vse of them) wee might take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite more true delight and comfort in one day, then wee haue done in all worldly pleasures and vaine sports in our whole life. An example whereof we haue in the kingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, who had so weaned his affections from the world, and inured them to feed on these spirituall banquets, that feeling their sweetnesse he could not in comparison thereof relish at all the chiefe comforts which he found in the world: for so he professeth, that he had more ioy of heart when the light of Gods countenance shined vpon him, then worldly men had, when their wheate and wine did abound; that he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Gods law rather then gold, yea though it were most pure<note place="margin">Psal. 4. 7.</note> in qualitie, and much in quantitie; and that hee found more sweetnesse in it then in the honie and honie combe. That
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:10731:241"/> Gods testimonies were his delight and his counsellers; that<note place="margin">Psal. 9. 10. &amp; 119. 14. 24. 97. 103. 111. 162.</note> he had taken Gods testimonies as his heritage for euer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were the ioy of his heart, and that he reioyced in Gods word, as one that had found a great spoile. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when for his sinne he had lost the sense and feeling of this delight and comfort, it was not all the ioy and pleasure of a kingdome that would giue his mind contentment, but as one robbed and depriued of all his pleasure, he earnestly desireth God to restore it vnto him: <hi>Make me</hi> (saith he) <hi>to heare ioy and gladnes, that the bones which thou hast broken may</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 51. 8. 12.</note>
                  <hi>reioyce: restore me to the ioy of thy saluation, and stablish me with thy free Spirit:</hi> and elsewhere, he saith, <hi>that except Gods</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Chron. 29. 9.</note>
                  <hi>law had been his delight, he should haue perished in his affliction.</hi> So it is said, that when the people offered willingly towards the building of the Temple, they reioyced with great ioy. And thus our Sauiour Christ took such pleasure in doing his Fathers will, that it more delighted him, then to eat his meat when he was an hungred; and his beloued Apostle profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,<note place="margin">Iohn 4. 34.</note> that he tooke no greater ioy in any thing, then to see the fruits of his Apostleship, and to heare that his sonnes, whom he had begotten vnto God, did walke in his truth. Which examples (if we had the like holy hearts and sanctified affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions)<note place="margin">Ioh. epist. 3. 4.</note> we would follow, weaning our selues from deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in worldly vanities, that we might wholly ioy in the Lord, and in these spirituall pleasures; which if we would do, then should we find more comfort in this course, then euer the world could afford vnto vs; for the Lord would not giue vs ioy with a sparing hand; but as the Prophet speaketh, we <hi>should be satisfied with the fatnesse of his house, and God would</hi>

Now it followeth that according to my order propounded, I also proue, that by reason of this their vanitie, they do not satisfie, or bring contentment to those who most abound with them: for whereas that which is substantially and truly good, filleth and replenisheth the place where it is, these worldly things which are but vaine shadowes and false resemblances of this goodnes, being receiued into our hearts, though they much cumber the roome, yet they do not fill it, but in their greatest plentie, leaue the greatest emptines. They promise indeed when we pursue them, that they will giue vs contentment when we enioy them; and (like the harlot in the Prouerbs)<note place="margin">Prou. 7. 18.</note> when they allure vs to folly, and to the committing of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall fornication, by setting our hearts on them more then God, that we shall take our fill in their loue: and those who are insnared with these inticements, when with all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and painfull endeauours they pursue these bewitching vanities, they imagine like the foolish builders of Babel, that<note place="margin">Genes. 11. 3.</note> they shall eternize their name, and climbe vp euen into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen at their owne pleasure; but vpon triall they find nothing but trouble and confusion; for these goodly castles of their hopes which the great Magitian Satan offered vnto them for the wages of ther sinfull seruice, as places of sure refuge in all wants and dangers, vanish away when in their greatest need they flie vnto them for succour and defence: and these beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull strumpets, with whose loue he hath weaned their harts from God, like shadowes vanish, when they come to imbrace them; leauing behind them no comfort or contentation. In which respect those who dote vpon worldly vanities, and
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:10731:242"/> thinke to satisfie their minds in their fruition, are like vnto the hungrie man, who dreameth that he eateth, but when he awaketh he is still emptie; or to the thirstie man, who drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that he drinketh, but arising from his sleepe remaineth still athirst, as the Prophet speaketh: or as the Wise man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth<note place="margin">Esai. 29. 8.</note> them, they are like vnto the graue and destruction, which are neuer satisfied; and to the horseleaches, which<note place="margin">Prou. 27. 20.</note> crie, giue, giue, and are neuer filled. And as those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Prou. 30. 15.</note> vexed with the disease called the dogs hunger, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies eating, but neuer sufficed, so as it is more easie to burst their stomackes, then to satisfie their appetite: so howsoeuer worldly men are still feeding their hopes and desires, with these earthly vanities, yet their minds remaine as emptie and vnsatisfied, as they were whē they first tasted of thē: wherby the vanitie and worthlesnesse of these worldly things plainly appeareth, seeing that is said to be vaine, which like a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow<note place="margin">

And as those who are sicke of a burning feauer, howsoeuer in the time of their health they were not much troubled with thirst, being inwardly vexed with the raging burning of their disease, do desire abundance of drinke; and hauing that they longed for, are not satisfied, but the more they drinke, the more they thirst, because it is an vnnaturall heate which causeth this vnnaturall appetite: so when soules
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:10731:242"/> are in health, a little doth content them, but when they are diseased with the burning heate of worldly concupiscence, this vnnaturall appetite is neuer satisfied, but the more they haue, the more they desire, and the neerer they are to abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and superfluitie, the further they are from contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and whereas at first they had some stay of themselues, and some power to moderate their desires, now hauing gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the raines to their concupiscence, it runneth on with headlong violence, and admitteth no restraint: like vnto those standing on the top of a steepe hill, who howsoeuer they can easily rule themselues whilest they keep their place, or if they warily creepe downe by little &amp; slow degrees, yet if they begin once to runne, they can make no stay, till with great perill they come headlong to the bottome.</p>

                  </note> it commeth to passe through the iust iudgement of God, who (seeing worldlings loue his gifts better then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that gaue them, and in stead of being moued by his bountie to serue him with more alacritie, do commit idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie with these earthly vanities) doth lay this heauie curse vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that they shall not be able to satisfie them or giue contentment, yea rather the more they shall feed vpon them, the more their hunger shall be increased. And this is that iudgement and malediction which the Lord denounceth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Israelites, for neglecting the duties of his seruice, that they <hi>should eate and not haue enough;</hi> the which iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Hosea. 4. 10.

And because (as one saith) no man possesseth God, but he who is first posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of him, let vs become a possession vnto God, that he may become a possession vnto vs; and if wee haue him wee shall haue enough: for what can suffice him whom the infinite▪ Creator cannot satisfie? Another reason of this vnsatiablenes of mans mind with these worldly vanities, may bee their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in nature, in that it is heauenly and spirituall, and these earthly and corporall, in regard whereof there can bee no proportion betweene them; and therefore as it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to replenish a corporall emptinesse with a spirituall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as a chest with vertues, or the stomacke with wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; so is it no more possible to fill a spirituall emptinesse with a bodily substance, as the soule and mind of man with earthly treasures, or worldly preferments. And therefore
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:10731:243"/> when we feed our hungry soules with this vnnaturalll food, it doth not satisfie our appetite, but rather encreaseth our hunger.

And therefore as his follie were ridiculous, who being an hungred should seeke to satisfie his appetite by gaping after the wind; and finding that a lesser gale would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, should runne to the wind-mill hill to receiue a greater: so no lesse foolish are those worldly men, who finding their hearts emptie, and tormented with the hunger of greedie concupiscence, doe thinke to stay their appetite by feeding
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:10731:244"/> vpon this wind of worldly vanities; and failing of their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation in a lesser quantitie, thinke to attain vnto their hope, when they haue heaped vp to themselues a greater; for the defect is not in the matter, but in the nature and qualitie of the nourishment, there being no similitude or proportion betweene a spirituall soule, and corporall substances. They doe indeede for the present seeme to satisfie and asswage the hunger, but afterwards it is enraged with greater greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: euen as cold drinke doth giue some present cooling and refreshing to him who is in a fit of a burning feuer, but soon after the heat returning with greater violence bringeth with it more intollerable thirst. And as the fire at the first ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting on of wood or oyle, hath for the instant the heat therof somewhat abated, but presently after hauing caught hold of the matter, it waxeth much more hote then it was before: so worldly men pursuing these earthly vanities, after they haue attained vnto their hopes, haue for the instant some content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but within a while the rage of their concupiscence reuiueth and encreaseth, tormenting their soules with more vnquenchable thirstinesse then that which they felt before they tasted them. If therefore we would haue such sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of these worldly things as may bring contentment, wee must attaine vnto it by moderating our affections, rather then by multiplying these vanities; if wee would haue this aguish thirst slaked and abated, it must not bee by larger drinking of these vnsatisfying drinkes, which will but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease our appetite; but by purging away the fretting choler of worldly concupiscence, which is the true cause of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiablenesse: and if wee would haue this deuouring fire of our greedie desires quenched, let vs not foolishly heape vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it more of that matter whereby it is nourished; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">

For how many doe we daily see aduanced to the highest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, abounding with riches, and wallowing themselues in al worldly delights, who are as vnsatisfied and farre from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, as those who most want them? How many shall we obserue consuming their daies in melancholick passions, and humorous discontent, whom the world hath enriched with his best meanes to make them happie? how many are there who are heauie, sorrowfull, and euer complaining; who if they were asked cannot tell what they want, as though they were pressed downe with the waight of their own felicity, and thought themselues vnhappie, because they haue drunke so deepely of the worlds happinesse? And this commeth to passe because this sun-shine of worldly prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doth mollifie and effeminate the mind, making it foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly wanton, and through wantonnes wayward &amp; peeuish; and through this froward waiwardnes, hardly pleased with all the worlds best fauours, and discontented when the least occurrent crosseth their will, or but the least appearance of euill looketh towards them. Herein like vnto foolish chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who being brought vp vnder seuerer discipline, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually restrained of their will, doe patiently endure it, though they are denied necessaries, and are much affected and ouerioyed when they haue a little liberty, or some small fauour vouchsafed them from their gouernours; whereas if they be cockered by their parents, and haue in all things their wils and vaine humours satisfied, they grow in a while so wanton, and through wantonnesse so wayward, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will please them, or keepe them from crying and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining; but are much more froward in their fulnesse, and discontented in the fruition of all that they can desire;

               <p>And thus haue I generally shewed the insufficiencie of<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. That honors bring no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to those that haue them.</hi>
                  </note> worldly vanities, for the bringing of contentment to those that haue them. Let vs now take a more speciall view of it in honors, riches, and bewitching pleasures. And first for honor, how should it satisfie and giue contentment, seeing it is but a name, title, or conceited shadow, which hath it subsistence in the vngrounded opinions and vaine breath of the vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant multitude, and like a smoake is carried about with the winde of mens mouthes? And therefore those that rest vpon it for the sufficing of their ambitious and hungrie appetites, haue that slender pittance of the false Pastors, through Gods<note place="margin">Ierem. 22. 22.</note> iust iudgement allotted vnto them, in stead of meate feeding vpon the aire; and with <hi>Ephraim</hi> they gape after the winde<note place="margin">Hosea 12. 1.</note> which puffeth them vp with vaine-glorious pride, but affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto them no substantiall nourishment: and therefore vnto such the saying of the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> may fitly be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>ye haue eaten and are not satisfied.</hi> In which respect this<note place="margin">Haggai 1. 6.</note> breath of honor is not vnfitly compared to the smell and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the kitchin, which doth not nourish, or so much sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie with the sent, as it doth sharpen the appetite by the sight. By reason whereof ambitious men are insatiable in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring honors (because they are vaine and do not satisfie) and being not filled with that which they affect, they can put no end vnto their appetite; still they are climing the ladder of preferment, and aspire to seate themselues in the throne of highest honor; but neuer do they find contentment in the things they so much desire; for either they catch a fall whilest their hast in climing exceedeth their prouidence and heed; or being come to their desired height, they are not so much satisfied with this superlatiue and transcendent glorie, as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented and displeased, because there is no higher place vnto which their ambition may aspire. It may be when they first gaue way to these proud desires, they propounded vnto themselues some low or meane pitch, which if they could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto, their deceitfull heart promised them to rest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; but as the rich glutton craued but a drop of water to
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:10731:245"/> coole his tongue, when as a whole riuer would not haue quenched his tormenting heate: so at first they desire but small preferment, and as it were to set vp but one foot vpon this ladder, but finding herein little ease, they aspire higher and higher; till at last they haue ascended so high, that they hold it vnsafe to turne themselues, or stand still vpon this tottering ladder, and thinke there is no securitie till they be come to the top, and haue seated themselues in the royall throne. Manifold examples hereof we haue in the booke of God, and in the histories of all ages. It was not sufficient for <hi>Corah</hi> and his companions, to haue chiefe places in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, so long as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were aboue them. <hi>Abimelech</hi> could not indure to gouerne with his brethren, but he must be sole Monarch, though to accomplish his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, he must commit them all to the slaughter. It was nothing to <hi>Absalon</hi> to be the Kings sonne, in possibilitie after his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers decease to weld the Scepter, vnlesse presently he may clime vp into the throne, though he could no otherwise ascend, vnlesse he would make his deare fathers dead bodie his first step. Among the Heathens it is said of <hi>Cesar,</hi> that he could indure no superiour, and of <hi>Pompey,</hi> that he could not abide an equall; and of great <hi>Alexander</hi> it is recorded, that the world could not satisfie his ambition, and therefore his great Soueraignty and Monarchy could not bring vnto him so much ioy and contentment, as to restraine teares, because there were no more worlds to conquer, or as some haue it, because hearing there were many, he had not yet conquered one. And of the most of the great Emperours we see it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that earthly glorie could not satisfie them, vnlesse they also attained vnto diuine honors, and were reputed among the gods. Neither is it any maruell if these men could not get out of this intricate and endlesse laberynth of pride, hauing no better guide then blind nature to leade them; seeing the Apostles, who had heard so many holy and powerfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of humilitie, preached by our Sauiour Christ, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed vnto them by his gratious example, were yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding so ambitiously affected, that they thought it not preferment enough to haue chiefe places in his glorious

By all which it appeareth, that after we haue once drunke of this poison of ambition, our inward burning heate maketh our thirst so vnquenchable, that we shall soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner burst then rest satisfied. And therefore the Prophet fitly compareth this thirsting after worldly honors, to the thirst of drunkards; for as their first cups serue to quench their thirst and satisfie nature, but those which follow, inwardly inflaming them, do renue and increase their appetite, till at last it grow insatiable: so whereas these men might haue rested satisfied and contented, when their honors and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were moderat, now hauing by addition of more mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inflamed their hearts with the fire of ambition, nothing will suffice, but their desires (as the same Prophet speaketh) being inlarged like the gulfe of hel, and the vnsatiable iawes of death, can no more be satisfied then either of them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe they euer thinke whence they ascended, but onely whither they are purposed to clime; nor euer marke how many they haue outrunne in this race of honor, but only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue how many are still before them.</p>

In vaine therefore doe couetous men toile themselues, whilest they seeke to satisfie their hungrie appetite by multiplying their wealth; for as the Iuie groweth with the Oke, so doth couetousnesse with riches; and as their wealth increaseth, so likewise doe their desires that haue it. Wherein couetousnesse resembleth a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer which hath but a small beginning, and a weake course at the head and fountaine from which it first springeth; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:10731:247"/> by the way many brooks which fall into his stream, groweth strong and vnresistable; for so when a man first let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth couetousnesse into his heart, it is but weake and easilie checked, but when wealth and riches come vpon him, the streame of his concupiscence groweth so violent, that neither reason, nor religion can withstand it.</p>
               <p>By which it plainely appeareth, that the more couetous<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 9. That couetous men, the more they abound, the more they want.</hi>
                  </note> men abound with wealth, the more their pouerty is encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; for seeing the mind is the true measure of riches, and he onely is to be accounted rich who hath such sufficiencie and plentie as doth giue contentment; and seeing, as I haue she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, those who set their hearts vpon riches, haue by their increase their appetite also increased, and the more they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in wealth, the lesse are their minds filled and sufficed; therefore it must needs follow, that as they increase in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall riches, so also their internall pouerty is encreased. For the more they haue, the more they desire; the more they desire, the greater is their want, and the more they want, the poorer they are; and consequently the more they haue, the more their pouerty is increased. What they haue not, that they desire; what they desire, of that (at least in their owne iudgement) they stand in need; how great therefore is the want of these rich beggers, which need all the wealth<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Toto mundo eget, cuius non capit mundus cupiditates.</hi> Ambros. de Nabuth. cap. 12 Chrysost. in Rom. 8.

So that (as one saith) this vice of couetousnesse hath in it such contrarieties, that it is like vnto a riddle; seeing hee that hath most, hath also the greatest want; for as they increase in wealth, they increase in their wishes and desires, and great desires argue great wants. For example, whilest a man is poore he wisheth onely for hundreds, promising vnto himselfe contentment if he could obtaine his desires; hauing attained hundreds, he now wisheth for thousands, and comming to thousands hee affecteth millions, and thinketh it now a kind of pouerty to haue his riches and treasures numerable. So that hee now skorneth his old desires, and contemneth hundreds if they be offered vnto him as a prey; not for that hee is satisfied and needeth no more, but because with his wealth his wishes,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:10731:248"/> and with his wishes his wants are increased; and therefore he despiseth these small cups, because he thirsteth after great riuers, and no lesse then whole streames of riches can so much<note place="margin">

Now if it bee the onely true riches, not to haue much, but to stand in need of nothing, and to abound in all things which a man desireth; then how great is their pouerty, who being vnsatisfied, want so much? how farre are they from true riches which are so straitned in their minds, and haue their hearts like a bottomlesse gulfe full of nothing but want and penurie?</p>
               <p>In which respect the condition of couetous rich men is<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 10. That couetous rich men are more in want then the poore.</hi>
                  </note> much more miserable then theirs who are of the poorer sort, seeing their wants being measured according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, are much greater; for these neede but little, because they desire not much; whereas they stand in need of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, because it is no little will giue them contentment. Now as his estate is very miserable who is tormented with an insatiable thirst, though he haue his cellers full of drinke; and he much better in his condition, who as hee hath little store, so also he hath little thirst; so much more miserable is he whose mind is insatiable, through this dropsie of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, though he haue abundance; then such an one as hauing little, is notwithstanding contented with that hee hath. Take for example <hi>Achab</hi> and <hi>Naboth,</hi> the one hauing a kingdome, the other some small possessions. But yet hee who had abundance, and the reuenues of a kingdome, is not satisfied with all he possesseth, but greedily coueteth the poore mans vineyard; on the other side <hi>Naboth</hi> hath but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yet that little so contenteth him, that hee desireth none of the kings abundance. Now which of these was truely rich, he that seemed to want, because his poore neighbour had a vineyard which he thought worth his desiring; or the other that is satisfied with his owne possessions? whether of the two was poorer, he who wanted no more then hee enioyed,<note place="margin">Ambros. lib. de Nabuth. cap. 2.</note> but rested content with his owne; or hee who greedily co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueted that which belonged to another? Surely this man was much more poore in his affection, then the other in his estate and possession. Whereby it appeareth that the insatiable rich
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:10731:248"/> man, is much worse then those that are of poore estate; yea surely herin the very beasts are to be preferred before him; for they whē hunger inciteth thē hunt after their prey, but when their stomacke is sufficiently filled, their appetite also resteth satisfied, desiring no more till againe hunger prouoketh them. But (as wee say) the couetous mans eye is farre worse then his bellie; for when hee hath enough and too much in his possession hee greedily hunteth after more, and is neuer satisfied so long as he seeth any thing which is to be desired. To this purpose one of the ancients speaketh fitly. Couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (saith he) the more it taketh from others and raketh<note place="margin">

T. 4.</note> together, the more poore it is in it owne opinion; it enuieth all men, and is vile to it selfe; it is poore, in abundance of riches; and needie in affection, when it is rich in possession. It hath no meane in raking, because it hath no measure of desiring. It so inflameth the mind, and feedeth his soule with his fire, that it seemeth onely in this to differ from lust, that this lusteth after beautifull persons, and that the heauie earth. It troubleth the elements, ploweth vp the sea, diggeth the earth, and with varietie of wishes wearieth the heauens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thankfull neither for faire weather nor for foule; it repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly extenuateth the yeerely profits, and findeth fault with the fruits of the earth.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore couetousnesse is vnsatiable, let vs not<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 11. That it is in vaine to seeke for contentment in riches.</hi>
                  </note> seeke for sufficiencie and contentment in earthly abundance, imagining that the more wee encrease in riches, the sooner we shall rest satisfied: for when our desires exceed measure, wee cannot attaine vnto contentment by adding to our wealth, but by detracting from our concupiscence; not by increasing our riches, and filling our chests with siluer and gold, but by diminishing our greedy appetite, and emptying our hearts of vnsatiable couetousnesse. For as well may a man fill a sieue with water, or a bottomles purse with money, as a couetous heart with sufficiencie of riches. And therefore as his follie were rediculous, who should endeauour to fill a leaking or bottomlesse vessell in a ditch or pond, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to doe it, should carrie it to a full riuer, or the maine sea, because the reason why it cannot bee filled, is not in the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:10731:249"/> quantitie of the water, but in the quality of the vessell, for if he would stop the leakes, he might as easily fill in a standing poole, as in the great ocean: so the follie of couetous world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings is no lesse absurd, who when they cannot satisfie their greedie hearts with competent store of riches, couet after more, thinking to giue them contentment when they can<note place="margin">

                  </note> wallow in the abundance of their wealth: but all in vaine; for the fault is not in the too little quantity of their riches, but in the vnsatiable greedinesse of their mindes, which can neuer be satisfied. And therefore they should not seeke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment by filling their emptie harts in an ocean of wealth, but rather by stopping those leakes which are made by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse, and so would small store of wealth better satisfie them, then the great reuenues of a rich kingdome. For hee is not contented who hath enough, but he hath enough who is contented, seeing when he cannot fit his state to his mind, he fitteth his mind to his estate, &amp; so is satisfied with a little, because he desireth not much. Now as he is truely rich which hath as much as he wanteth or desireth; so he onely is to bee esteemed poore, which wanteth that which he hath not; for if not hauing wealth he neither wanteth nor desireth it, hee is rich in his mind, though he be poore in possessions: neither is he to be esteemed poore, whose mind agreeth with his state, but he who though he haue abundance is not satisfied: seeing pouertie consisteth rather in the penurie of the mind, then in the absence of riches, and not in hauing little, but in not hauing that which is enough.</p>
               <p>Another reason why the heart is not satisfied with these worldly things, is, because they who are possessed of them, cannot find in their hearts to vse them; and though they haue abundance of earthly treasures, yet are they so charmed with these idols, vpon which they haue set their hearts, that they dare not touch them, or any way conuert them to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit: resembling herein the Indian Ants, which (as it is said<note place="margin">Plutarch. de Cupid. diuit.</note> of them) taking great paines in gathering gold, do neuer vse it, but only hide it, so that others can haue no benefit by it: or him who being spent with sicknesse, hath his table furnished with all manner of dainties, but wanteth a stomacke to feed
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:10731:249"/> vpon them: wherein greedie auarice hath one folly pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar vnto it selfe, aboue all other kinds of concupiscence. For whereas other vicious affections moue men to long after their obiects for fruition, as the glutton after daintie meats, that he may feed vpon them: the drunkard after pleasant wines, that he may drinke them; the ambitious man after preferments, that he may enioy them; neither doth loue in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing make a man abstaine from the vse &amp; fruition of the thing loued; only couetousnes maketh a man fall into this folly, letting his money lie by him without vse of it (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be such a vse as whereby it selfe is increased) and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staineth to feed on these daintie meats, which aboue all other his soule loueth, because he hath an ouer great appetite vnto them; as if a man would not therefore put on his clothes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is cold; or drinke, because he is athirst: whereof it commeth to passe that he hath no more contentment by his wealth, nor vse of any thing which he possesseth for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of his greedie appetite, then a thirstie man hath of the drinke, which still remaineth vndrawne in the vessell, for the quenching of his thirst.</p>

<pb n="432" facs="tcp:10731:250"/> they bring to their louers, and the lesse satietie? Howsoeuer therefore these misers abound with store of true gold and siluer, yet they are but false riches; seeing they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stretch and inlarge the iawes of greedie auarice, but do not fill or satisfie them, and rather inflame then quench the heate of couetousnes.

               <p>Finally, as these misers are wretched and full of follie; so are they emptie of al goodnesse, seeing they are neither good to others, nor to themselues; others haue no good by them, seeing they are ready rather to scrape from them by oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and deceit, then to communicate to their necessities. For whereas they vsually alledge, that they therefore gather, that they may prouide for their posterity, or y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they may do good deeds at their death; it is manifestly false, both because those that haue no children, or neere friends, are as wretchedly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous as they who haue most; and also because if they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered riches to communicate them to the good of others, they would (seeing charity beginneth at home) impart them to their owne vse and benefit: if it were simplie their desire by their wealth to doe good after their death, they would also bee ready in some measure to imploy it to these vses in their time of life: if loue of their posterity made them so greedilie to heape vp riches, this loue would moue them to impart some share vnto them, when as they might still keepe it in their owne possession. But experience teacheth vs, that these rich misers pinch euen their dearest children of that necessarie allowance which belongeth to their backes
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:10731:253"/> and bellies; and which is worst of all, will not affoord vnto them good education, because it requireth cost: whereby it manifestly appeareth that the loue of nothing but of their money, and that for it owne sake, without respect of further vse, is the true cause of all their greedie scraping. And to say truth, how can he be good to others who is naught to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe? how can he be anothers friend, who is his owne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie? But the couetous miser (as euen the heathen man could<note place="margin">

He fareth hardly, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth basely, and in all respects maketh vnto himselfe a more short allowance, for all his great care and labour, then any master (vnlesse he were as wretched as he) would afford vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. In which respect one concludeth that the miser is not onely a theefe, but also a selfe-murtherer, seeing hee will not allow vnto himselfe necessaries to preserue life.

Wherein the miser doth onely this worke of iustice in all his cariage, that he doth not cast away his wealth vpon his vnworthie selfe, but reserueth it safe and vntouched, for those who bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deserue to enioy and spend it. Rightly therefore is this miserablenesse called a wormewood sinne, which bringeth his punishment in the very committing, sauing that it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sweete nor wholesome, but a delightfull vexation, a rich beggerie, a superfluous penurie and affected want, which turneth. Gods blessings into cursings; his gifts into clogs, and maketh all his benefits heauie burthens. And this commeth to passe by the iust iudgement of God punishing their immoderate loue of these earthly things; that though they should haue abundance in possession, yet they should haue nothing in fruition, much in keeping and nothing in vse, because hee so straiteneth their hearts and restraineth their liberty, that like the prince in the booke of the Kings

                  </note> worldly riches, both because they are vaine and cannot sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie; and also because our hearts are vnsatiable, and our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarice so strong and tyrannous that wee neither can nor will be satisfied by them. Now in the last place we are to examine pleasures, to see whether we can in them find any satietie or contentment: where vpon triall wee shall find, that they are as vaine and insufficient for his purpose as either of the other. For like sweete drinkes, they serue not to abate and quench, but to encrease the voluptuous mans thirst; making him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the enioying of one pleasure, to hunger after another; and after he hath enioyed thousands, to be as farre from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, as when first he began to couet them; because be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vaine they vanish in the fruition, and slip away whilest they are betweene our hands; like a shadow, leauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing behind them but an emptie mind and hungrie desire after new varietie. Yea rather the more wee enioy them, the further wee are from contentation; seeing euery delight is vnto vs as a taste of sweetnesse, which doth not satisfie but sharpen our licorous appetites: and howsoeuer like the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the smiths forge, they seeme for the present to quench and allay our heate, yet soone after, the flame of our concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence increaseth, and burneth much more hotly. So that howsoeuer before wee tasted of these bewitching delights, we were masters of our owne affections, and could moderate our desires: yet after wee haue beene allured to enter into pleasures maze, we find not our comming out so easie as our going in; and when we haue been inticed to drinke of these golden, but yet intoxicating cups, wee are presently made
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:10731:254"/> drunke with delight; and drunkennesse increasing thirst, maketh vs in the end to grow insatiable. And this emptines and insatiety doth make vs often both to change, and also to reiterate the same pleasures; that they which cannot at once satisfie, may by our continuall feeding on them, at least keep vs from famishing. For example, what doth dainty meates bring with them, but a vaine delight, which presently va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth, either by renued hunger, which againe desireth them, or through their surcharging the stomacke, vpon which follow crude humors and ill digestion, which causeth vs to loath them? So, how vaine is the pleasure of the most delicate drinks, which delight no longer then they are swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing downe, and do not fully satisfie, but only for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent allay our thirsty appetite? The like may be said of odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous smels, which delight then only whilest they are at the nose; of pleasing sights, which no longer please then they are in the eye; of sweet musicke, which vanisheth and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth nothing behind, when the consort ceaseth; of merrie company, and pleasing sports and pastimes, whose delight lasteth no longer, then their present fruition; and in a word, of all other pleasures that the world affordeth, which filling vs full of nothing, but vaine emptines, do make vs like the thirsty grounds to open the mouth, gaping after the pleasing showers of new delights. And of this <hi>Salomon</hi> himselfe had<note place="margin">Eccles. 2.</note> experience, who though he surfetted of pleasure, yet he was not filled, and when he had suffered his heart to glut it selfe with variety of delights, yet he remained altogether vnsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, only in the end by much vse he came to loathing satie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and was vexed in his mind, because he had spent so much good time in the fruition of these base vanities.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd thus haue I shewed that these worldly<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 1. That all men are disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their estate, and first those who are of honorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
                  </note> things do not satisfy those which are most possessed of them; from which insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie proceed diuers effects, which bring much trouble and disquietnes to the life of man. The first is, that because no man is satisfied with the things he possesseth, therfore none are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with their owne state and condition, but seeing only their owne wants, and not other mens, and by a foolish and selfe-deceiuing sophistrie, comparing themselues with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not in those things wherin they match or exceed them, but setting the beautie of other mens state, against the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes of their owne, their commodities against their owne discommodities, and matching their fulnes, with that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are most wanting and defectiue; at last they grow to this conclusion, that no man is so miserable as they; the which in truth is not so, or therefore only so, because they thinke so: whereas if in comparing themselues with others, they would obserue due proportion, fitting their owne bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, with the benefits of others; their owne defects with their wants, and their discommodities and euils, with those which others sustaine; they would be comforted, either because, all things considered, their owne estate is better then other mens; or else because in their miseries they haue all the world to beare them companie. But this discontentednes, the vsuall companion of insatietie, will better appeare, if we descend to some particulars, and take a briefe view of the seuerall states and conditions of men. And first for men of honorable qualitie, because honor it selfe is vaine and doth not satisfie them, they are neuer contented with their owne estate, but finding in themselues an hungring emptines, and pinching
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:10731:256"/> want, &amp; not knowing that it is the disease of their mind, but rather imagining that it is some defect in their outward cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they grow into dislike of it, and aspire to some higher preferment, thinking that height and happinesse, aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and content will come together. Thus the man of meane qualitie thinketh his basenes an heauie burthen, and aspireth vnto the reputation of a gentleman, supposing that there is much more contentment in gentilitie then in yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manrie: but when he hath attained vnto it, not finding in his new estate, that for which he looked, he resteth not heere, but goeth on in his endlesse iorney of ambition, and affecteth nobilitie; and being enobled he is neuer the neerer vnto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, because he doth not looke vnto those whom he hath outgone, but vnto those who are yet aboue him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not so much contented because he excelleth the most, as he is tormented to see any preferred before him; and this maketh him not to stay heere, but now he affecteth Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie, imagining it a goodly thing to rule, and that there is great contentment in this supreme authoritie, vnto which all stoope, it selfe stooping to none; but before the crowne be well setled to his head, he finds that it doth not giue his head-ach of ambition any ease, but only tormenteth him with the heauie waight, and therefore being not yet satisfied he affects Monarchies; and hauing no higher place vnto which he may clime on earth, he aspires vnto diuine honors, vsurping both the titles and worship which is peculiar vnto God. And thus do ambitious men tire themselues in seeking content where it is not to be found, and torment themselues when they find it not: and hauing placed their happinesse in honor, they aspire vnto one preferment after another, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king when they misse of it, that it is only wanting in that degree vnto which they haue attained, and not in honor it selfe.</p>
               <p>The like discontent is to be found among those who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. The discontent which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth riches and pleasures.</hi>
                  </note> riches; for being altogether vnsatisfied with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent possessions, they grow into dislike of their estate, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king others more happie, because they are more rich; and therefore hauing outstripped one richer then themselues,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:10731:256"/> they labour to ouertake another, and hauing also outrunne him, they propound vnto themselues a third; imagining that there is none in worse estate, whilest there is any better, none poorer, whilest there is any richer, and that they haue outgone none, so long as they see any go before them; as though other mens abundance were their want, and so much were detracted from their estate, as they see others do exceed them. And thus also those who place all their felicitie in worldly pleasures, are vtterly discontented with their state and condition, when they find that those they haue do not satisfie them, or see that others go beyond them in varietie of delights; taking no pleasure, but rather fretting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uying, when they see their idoll more propitious to others then themselues, though they also haue in the same kind a large measure of fauour imparted vnto them. And thus the glutton abounding with good fare, thinketh that he feedeth but grosly, when he seeth more daintie cates at another mans table: thus the drunkard loatheth his best wines, when he meeteth with better in another mans cellar: thus he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in musicke contemneth his owne consort, as though there were nothing in it but iarring discord, when he heareth more melodious harmonie. And in a word, thus all sorts of voluptuous men distaste their seuerall delights, when either being glutted with them, they find satietie without satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or see that others haue any priuiledge and preeminence more then they, in respect of the qualitie or varietie of their pleasure.</p>
               <p>Neither are only these worldly things, honors, riches, and<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. That all men in all ages and in all estates, are full of discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi>
                  </note> pleasures, accompanied with discontent, but all other things in the world bring the same dislike to euery condition and estate: and to begin with the beginning of our life; we see that the child is wearie of his childhood, because he feareth the rod, and by seuerer discipline is restrained from his desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red delights; wishing that he were come to such an age as might exempt from these feares, and procure his liberty. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to youth he runneth himselfe out of breath, vnder the conduct of his vnbridled passions, till at last panting for wearines, he desireth that he were come to ripe age, when as
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:10731:257"/> he might rest from these vaine courses, and settle himselfe in some profitable calling, vnto which when hee hath attained he is not content, but thinking old age honourable, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that he might haue a share in that reuerence and respect which is due vnto it, in the meane time neuer thinking of the manifold infirmities, griefes and discontentments which it bringeth with it. Of which when hee tasteth, they are so burthensome vnto him, that hauing now no other age to change withall, he desireth to be vnburthened of them euen by death it selfe. The like discontent is to be obserued in all other states and conditions: hee that leadeth a single life is wearie of his solitarinesse, and thinketh there is no comfort equall to that sweet society of man and wife; being maried, he waxeth wearie of his yoke, either because hee hath made an ill and vnequall choice, or because hee is impatient of the cares and troubles incident to this estate, and now wisheth againe that he were at liberty. He that hath no children ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no pleasure in his possessions, because hee wanteth an heire to succeede him, and little playfellowes to beare him companie: he that hath children is not contented, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">Gen. 15. 2.</note> they are vnrulie, or ouer burthensome, imagining that if he had lesse companie, he should haue better store, and liue in greater plentie; and yet if he bee taken at his word hee is ready to repent, and to thinke that there is no greater losse, then when by hauing his companie lessened, he saueth of his former charges. The seruant thinketh his life a bondage, and wisheth meanes of liberty that hee might liue at his owne command; and when he is come to be a master, he is discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented much more, in gouerning and prouiding for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie. The people dislike their subiection, and grieuously complaine of their heauie burthens, tributes, taxes, customes and imposts; supposing that all worldly contentment resteth in soueraignty; the prince is no lesse wearie of his toile in ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, of his troubles, dangers, and continuall care, hauing not onely himselfe and priuate familie to looke to, but the whole people and common-wealth which shrowdeth it selfe vnder the wings of his prouidence. He that leadeth a priuate life, though he liketh of his ease, yet he is discontented, because
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:10731:257"/> hee wanteth respect, &amp; is not crouched vnto by suters, hauing no authority either to helpe or hurt them: they who are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced to publike place commend retirednesse, complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that they are so wholly taken vp with other mens busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, that they are constrained to neglect their owne; and whilest they labour for forraine intelligence, become igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of that which is done in their owne familie. The poore labouring-man is not contented with his condition, seeing after he hath toiled all the day, &amp; commeth wearie home, he there findeth but course fare and hard lodging; enuying the rich man his easie life, full tables, and downe-bedding. The rich also, though shame keepeth him from complaining, disliketh of his estate, wishing that he had lesse wealth so he had better health, and more labour so he had more strength; and could find in his heart to change fare with the poore man, so he might also change stomackes; and to lie as hard, if also he could sleepe so soundly, and take such quiet rest. The countrie man seeing the plentie and brauerie of citizens, groweth in dislike with his home-spun suit, and houshold▪ prouision, and wisheth rather that he lacked his farme, then that by staying him at home, he should bee thus debarred of citie preferments. The citizens thinke themselues ill seated by reason of bad aires, and dangerous sicknesses that raigne among them, and like better of the countrie mans life, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more healthie then theirs; and of his estate, as being more certaine, and in lesse danger of ruine and alteration. And finally, in the citie the artificer is wearie of his great paines and small gettings, and wisheth that he could change estats with the merchants, who haue more pleasure and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abundance. The merchant running many dangerous courses, by reason of boysterous tempests, spoyling pirats, and barbarous nations, thinketh them happie that sit quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though but poorely, by their owne fire; and if by any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualty their state bee impouerished, they wish that they had beene brought vp to some handie trade, and preferre a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall art aboue a great stocke, and skill in merchandise, seeing that may bee lost, and so this grow vnprofitable; whereas the other neuer faileth, but as a lease for life, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth

               <p>Now this commeth to passe, partly because wee are much<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. Of the causes why worldlings are so full of discontent.</hi>
                  </note> more sensible in feeling our owne miseries, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by experience we find the insufficiencie and vanity of those worldly things which our selues enioy, and are apt to thinke others benefits of a better quality; whereas in truth whatsoeuer is in the world is vaine and sufficeth not; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery condition hath good and euill, miseries and benefits, in such iust proportion tempered the one with the other, that if a man knew all, hee could hardly tell which to chuse: and in that this man is contented with his estate, and another is not; the true cause of this difference is not in the outward condition, but in the hart and mind. For al estates bring with them causes enow of discontentment, but one beareth them with wisedome and patience, and in thus bearing lesseneth them; whereas another by impatiencie aggrauateth his burthen, which in it selfe is not so heauie, and by strugling and striuing to shake it off, findeth no ease, but galleth his mind with griefe and sorrow. And as we see those who are of a strong constitution contentedly endure all weathers, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he who is weake and vnsound complaineth in winter of cold, and in the summer of heate: so those whose minds are healthie, constant, and strong in patience, are prepared for all estates and conditions; whereas hee who is infirme through impatiencie, and subiect to the ague fits of passion, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall discontent afflicteth himselfe with the cold winter of aduersitie▪ and the hotte summer of a prosperous estate, and both these come to passe, not because the one feeleth no
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:10731:258"/> waight, but because he hath strength to beare it; or that the other hath an heauier burthen, but because by reason of his weakenesse, a light loade is sufficient to presse him downe. As therfore the foot fashioneth the shooe, and not the shooe<note place="margin">Plutarch. de tranquil. anim.</note> the foot; for a crooked foote, maketh the shooe also croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; but contrariwise, a straight shooe will not make straight a clubbed and crooked foot: so the state is fashioned by the mind, and not the mind by the state; for if it be quiet and contented, then all outward things bring contentment to it; whereas if it be impatient, wayward and peeuish, euery fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seemeth an heauie burthen, all kind of occurrents vex and displease; and that which would bee anothers paradise<note place="margin">Optat ephippia bos piger, optat arare caballus Horat.</note> and delight, is vnto them an hell and grieuous torment. And hereof it is that men are discontented and complaine, not for the same causes only, but also for those which are diuers, yea quite contrarie one to another: as for example, one complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of his poore and base estate, which maketh him negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and contemned of al; another that his honors &amp; authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are too burthensome, &amp; that he is sued vnto by too many: one is vexed because he hath too many children; another because he hath none at all: this man crieth out of his multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of businesse, and his neighbour is as much troubled, because he is not troubled; and liuing at too much ease, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth imployment. One is tormented with iealousie, because hauing a beautifull wife she loued of al; another with sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iety and lothing, because she is deformed, and affected by no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And this commeth to passe partly because these worldly things are vaine, and cannot satisfie those that haue them; and partly by reason of the weakenesse and infirmity of mens minds, who bring no more contectment to their estate, then it bringeth to them; but make all things they enioy, which in themselues are vaine and scarce worth the keeping, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vnto them troublesome burthens, which bring cumber in carying, and ease when they are shaken off. For as the weake and sickly stomacke is made more sicke, and surfetteth with a small quantitie of wholesome food, turning the best meate into noysome humours, whereas that which is strong and healthie is wel refreshed, with a great meale of the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:10731:259"/> fare, and conuerteth it to profitable nourishment: so a weake and froward mind is surcharged euen with the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of a prosperous estate; whereas an heart which is indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with constancie and patience, is contented, and can well digest the meanest condition, and groweth daily in better liking, whilest it is fed with the bread of affliction, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of sorrow.</p>

                  </note> things is, that in stead of satisfying they bring with thē loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing satietie; for howsoeuer whilest men are in pursuit of these vanities, they thinke them of such excellency, that they would account it a great part of their happines, if they might enioy them; yet hauing obtained their desire, they are straight glutted with their companie, and now look vpon that with loathing contempt, which before they had it, they beheld with rauishing delight: and this commeth to passe, either because they after see things more desireable, and worthy their loue, in the possession of other men; or because they haue these things in excessiue measure, which maketh that which is most sweet to become loathsome; or because their appetite which was sharpned with want, labour in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and difficultie in obtaining, is dulled and taken away by their assiduitie, and easie inioying, without any competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to sharpen their loue: or finally, because whilest they were in the pursuite of these vanities, they were deceiued with a false conceit of their worth &amp; excellencie; which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is afterwards confuted by their own experience, which manifesteth their worthlesse basenes, and insufficiencie to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie and bring contentment. In which respect these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanities are fitly compared to the apples of Sodome, which allure the eye, and sharpen the appetite, but if any touch, or set his teeth in them, they fill his mouth with dust, or vanish into smoake; and those which dote vpon them are like vnto those who hauing sicke and weake stomackes, do long for many things when they heare them but named, and when they are procured with cost, and prepared with labour, they begin to loath them, as soone as they see them, and to waxe sicke as though they had surfetted, before they haue scarce
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:10731:259"/> tasted of them: or like vnto fond louers whose affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sharpened with competition, and difficulty of obtaining, do make idols of their mistresses, and admire them as though they were free from all fault and blemish, and full of diuine excellencies: but after inioying them for their wiues, thinke them scarce good enough to be their vnder fellowes, there being now in their conceit many more excellent, and free from imperfections. And thus the ambitious man groweth out of liking with his obtained honor, which before he had it, he was rauished with delight, when he did but thinke of it with some weake and vncertaine hope of inioying it, either because he seeth another (which selfe-loue maketh him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue is of lesse desert) better preferred, or because growing ordinarie and common by possession, it becomes stale and triuiall; or finally, because being vaine, it doth not satisfie and giue contentment, but rather sharpeneth the appetite, and inflameth the desire to aspire to an higher place; and a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honor being but entertained by desire, and nourished with the least hope, maketh the lesser to be contemned as base and worthlesse. Thus also the couetous man loatheth<note place="margin">

Finally, thus the voluptuous man is straight glutted with the fruition of those pleasures, which before he much desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the glutton loathing those meats which erewhile he
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:10731:260"/> longed after, and being cloyed with those drinkes, which when he was at another mans table, seemed most delicious. Thus he who delights in vaine shewes, sports and pastimes, taketh a monthes paines in preparation, and spares for no cost to make them most delightfull; and though both these set an edge on his appetite, yet he is often wearie of it before it be done, though it be but of some few houres continuance, and not finding that ioy and contentment which he expected, wisheth that it were past. By which the great vanitie of worldly things, and miserie of worldly men plainly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; for what can be more vaine then they, whose expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was better then their fruition, and whose worth ceaseth when they are inioyed? what can be more void of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, then that which is only precious when it is absent, and loseth all it value when it commeth to vse, experience spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it of all that worth which a false opinion had inriched it with.

<pb n="449" facs="tcp:10731:260"/> vanities satisfie not, yet they bring with them cloying sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tietie, the which being accompanied with loathsome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, enforceth the mind which naturally affecteth happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and full contentment (though it bee ignorant of the meanes whereby it may be attained) to fixe the desires vpon new obiects, to see if it can find that in them, which was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the other, wherein finding as little contentment as before, they leaue also them and affect new; till hauing run ouer all which they thinke worth the desiring, and hauing tried all things which the world calleth excellent (if at least they can with all their care and labour attaine vnto them) at length (like those who affect new fashions and strange at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires) when they haue tired their inuention, and know not what more to desire, they are faine to take vp the old againe which before they loathed, and after their glutted appetite is a little sharpned with absence and discontinuance, they place vpon it afresh their soone wearied delight, till their renued loathing moueth them vnto a new change. And thus world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men (like the horse in the mill) tire themselues in trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this endlesse circle, ending where they began, and being at the night of death as far from the iorney end of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, as when they began their daies trauaile: and not hauing fixed their hearts, and grounded their hopes vpon that neuer failing foundation, God all-sufficient and the eternall ioyes of his kingdome, they haue nothing solid and substantiall to rest vpon, but like a feather in the aire they are tossed to and fro with euery winde, seeking rest but finding none. And hauing long tired themselues in vaine, after manifold trials and new conclusions, finding no contentment, at last they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue to place all their delight in often change; and that which they cannot find in the substance or sufficiencie of worldly things, they looke for in continuall varietie, so that<note place="margin">Nihil est iucun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum nisi quod reficit varietas.</note> now there is nothing pleasing vnto them which varietie and change refresheth not: like vnto those lying in bed, and not sleeping or taking rest, who being wearied with waking, do spend the whole night in tumbling and tossing from one side to another, seeking for ease in their often change, which they cannot find by quiet lying on either side. And as those
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:10731:261"/> who are sicke of a burning feuer when they cannot satisfie their vnsatiable thirst, doe often change their drinke, one while longing after that which is tart and sharpe, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while after that which is coole and small; now affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting that which not long since in their health well pleased them in their neighbours house, as though it would now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so bring the same delight; and anon not finding their thirst quenched by change of drinkes, desire wine or water. But all in vaine; for hauing tried all, they complaine that they are al so bitter, that they doe not quench their thirst: whereas in truth it is the bitternesse of their mouth distasted with cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, the cause of their disease, and not the fault of their drink, and not because it is vnfit to quench their thirst, but because their burning heate still renuing and augmenting it, maketh it vnquenchable: So wee being diseased with the burning heate of concupiscence, thirst after worldly vanities, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by them to haue our heate abated; and after wee haue made triall of many, and yet find our thirst nothing quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we long after endlesse variety, neuer calling to mind that it proceedeth from our inward disease, and not from the want of outward things. A notable example whereof wee<note place="margin">Eccles. 2. 1. 2. &amp;c.</note> haue in <hi>Salomon,</hi> who labouring to find contentment in worldly things, and not finding it in any one of them, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his heart liberty to runne ouer all, making triall of one thing after another, till in the end he was tired with all. He sought for it in mirth, and findeth in stead of it madnesse; in pleasure, and discouereth nothing but vanity: Then he shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from one thing to another, and looketh for it, in great workes and stately buildings; where missing of it, hee goeth to seeke it in fruitfull vineyards, in delightfull gardens and orchards, in fountaines, springs, and pleasant groues; where not finding it, he proceedeth in the pursuit, and looketh for it in the multitude of siluer, gold, and princely treasures, then in delightfull musicke, then in many seruants and great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance; vnto which we may adde that which shame made him conceale, his multitude of wiues and concubines: but hauing tried all these and many other, withholding nothing from his eyes▪ which they desired, nor withdrawing his
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:10731:261"/> hart from any ioy; he findeth in all this variety, as the reward of all his labour, nothing else but vanitie and vexation of spirit.</p>
               <p>But this will better appeare, if wee doe but a little consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 7. The former point cleered by some speciall instances.</hi>
                  </note> of the speciall instances. For thus the ambitious man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting honour, and not being satisfied with that which hee hath attained vnto, is presently glutted with it, labouring after hew variety, one while seeking vaine glory, another while preferments; now the fauour of his prince, and soone after the applause of the common people. Or if hee settle his affection vpon any one of these, hee seeketh to refresh his glutted mind with variety in the degree, climing one step after another, till hee commeth to the highest; where being seated, hee is now further off from contentment then at the beginning, because he cannot change for the better, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light his vnsatisfied mind with wonted variety. Thus also the couetous man being vnsatisfied with his riches affecteth change, shifting his wearied appetite from one thing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, till all become tedious and troublesome. For finding no contentment in his old manors he desireth new lordships, being not pleased with one house, hee buildeth another; and not contented with that, hee erecteth a third much more stately; and being master of many, hee findeth contentment in none, which is the cause of his oft shifting from one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother with great cost and labour; but all in vaine is his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing, seeing hee still carieth his disease about him; and therefore is no more eased, then hee who being sicke of an ague, doth often change his bed. And as being wearie of his house he affecteth often change; so also is he no better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with his houshold stuffe, furniture, plate and apparell; and therefore being glutted with often sight of the same thing, herein also he makes variety the last refuge of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. And the like may be said of their gold, siluer and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; of which though they be neuer wearie in themselues, as being the idols vpon which they haue fixed their hearts, yet are they discontented with their share and portion, and therefore still affect greater quantities, till they haue more then they can tell how to vse.

Which as it should serue to make vs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne these earthly vanities, as being not able to bring any tranquillitie or sound comfort; so should it moue vs to
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:10731:262"/> seeke for this contentment, without which the life of man is miserable, not in these outward things which afford it not; but inwardly in our owne minds, by purging and purifying them from worldly concupiscence, and by fixing our hearts and affections vpon Gods spirituall graces and heauenly ioyes, the one whereof we may haue in possession, and the other in hope; without which all worldly things cannot sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, with which though wee bee abandoned of all earthly vanities, wee may haue tranquillitie of mind, and true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. For first if we haue the spirit of God, and his san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying graces dwelling in vs, we shall be filled and satisfied: for as our Sauiour Christ himselfe hath promised, <hi>whosoeuer</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 14.</note>
                  <hi>drinketh of this spirituall water which he shall giue him, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be more athirst, for it shall be in him as a well of water, sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp to euerlasting life.</hi> And <hi>he that beleeueth in him, out of</hi>

                  <hi>his bellie shall flow riuers of the water of life.</hi> And if wee would know what this well and riuer of the water of life is, which thus filleth and satisfieth vs, the Apostle telleth vs in the next words, that it is the spirit of God which he giueth to all that beleeue in Christ. So the Psalmist pronounceth him <hi>blessed whom God chuseth, and causeth to come vnto him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>

                  <hi>knowledge, that we may be filled with all the fulnesse of God.</hi> For if once we haue the spirit of God, a liuely faith, sincere loue, assured hope, and the rest of his sanctifying graces dwelling in vs, then are we thereby persuaded of the remission of our sinnes, our reconciliation with God, our adoption, whereby we become not onely sonnes, but also heires of all his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, then are wee assured of his fatherly prouidence still<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> watching ouer vs, which turneth all things by the wise and mighty working thereof to our good, especially to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of our eternall saluation. And this maketh vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe our selues wholly ouer to bee gouerned by his will, as knowing much better then our selues what is fit for vs; and to bee not onely contented, but also to reioyce, not in the state of prosperity alone, but euen in our affliction and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:10731:263"/> as the Apostle speaketh. An example whereof we<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 3.</note> haue in himselfe, who had attained vnto such a measure of this spiritual contentation, that it was able to beare him out, in all outward estates and conditions. <hi>I haue learned</hi> (saith<note place="margin">Philip. 4. 11. 12.</note> he) <hi>in whatsoeuer state I am to be content, and I can be abased, and I can abound; euery where in all things I am instructed, both to be full and to be hungrie, and to abound, and to haue want: I am able to do all things through the helpe of Christ that streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth me.</hi> And if we haue this spirituall contentment in our hearts, then the Lord will not let vs want this contentment, which the Apostle had in respect of outward things: for so he saith, that if <hi>his people would haue hearkened vnto his voice,</hi>

                  <hi>maketh rich, &amp; he doth adde no sorrowes with it:</hi> which blessing they alone haue sure interest in who are indued with Gods grace and holy Spirit: for well may those who are ruled with carnall concupiscence be rich in their outward estate, but they can neuer be rich in their mind with inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; <hi>for the wicked</hi> (as the Prophet saith) <hi>are like the raging</hi>

                  <hi>sea that cannot rest, whose waters cast vp mire and dirt;</hi> and the voice of God hath plainly said it, <hi>that there is no peace vnto them.</hi> But as for those in whose heart the peace of Gods holy Spirit dwelleth, they haue these outward things with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or content without them; the Lord supplying their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall defects with a sufficient measure of patience, comfort and tranquillitie of mind, and hauing godlinesse he also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs content with that we haue, whether it be much or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, something or nothing.</p>
               <p>The which inward contentation of mind, grounding it<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. That spirituall contentment much exceedeth all contentment in worldly things.</hi>
                  </note> selfe vpon Gods prouidence and promises, is in it owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture most excellent, and being compared is much to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before any contentment, which the confluence of all worldly benefits can bring vnto vs; for notwithstanding all these we may (as hath been shewed) be inwardly poore, in
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:10731:263"/> the middest of all our outward abundance; but this spirituall contentment alone maketh rich: for as the Apostle saith, <hi>Godlinesse is great riches with contentation;</hi> and why so? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 6. &amp; 4. 8.</note> (as before he told vs) <hi>it is profitable for all things, hauing the promises of this life, and the life to come.</hi> So that content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is grounded vpon outward things, is momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and of short continuance, lasting no longer then they last; for take away riches, pleasures, and preferments, which are the causes of this contentment, and the contentment it selfe must needs faile; whereas this inward spirituall contentment is alwaies durable and most constant, seeing it wholly resteth vpon Gods loue, holy will, and gratious prouidence, and therefore cannot faile, or be taken away by any worldly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, because it is not grounded vpon any worldly thing, and though all outward props should bee pulled away, yet would it stand vpright, because it resteth vpon none of them. Finally, worldly content is vaine and imperfect, not fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying the heart of man; but that which is spirituall is full in his degree, though not without infirmities, and doth sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie vs, not only for a fit, but euen for euer. For as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet speaketh, <hi>The Lord shall guide vs continually, and satisfie</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esay 58. 11.</note>
                  <hi>our soules in drought, and make fat our bones, and we shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water whose waters faile not.</hi> In which respect this spirituall contentment is much more excellent, then any which can be found in worldly things; euen as it is much better to haue enough, then to haue much; for he that hath much, if he want this spirituall contentment, still coueteth more in his greatest abundance, and he that coueteth still wanteth; but he who resting on God is inwardly content hath enough, because he desireth no more, and though his state be small, yet it putteth an end to his concupiscence, which all worldly things cannot do: for though we haue too much, yet if we be not moderated with content, we thinke we haue not enough; and though we haue much more then we desired, yet our concupiscence increasing with our commings in, we are readie to desire more: now as that which is enough, how meane a pittance soeuer it be, is not to be esteemed little, so that is not to be
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:10731:264"/> esteemed much, how great soeuer, which is not enough.</p>
               <p>But the excellencie of this spirituall contentment may<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. That content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine for all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series.</hi>
                  </note> hereby further appeare, in that whosoeuer hath it▪ hath a medicine of all miseries: for it is that which easeth the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of all afflictions, and maketh them light and easie: it tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our pouertie into the greatest riches, supplying all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wants with inward comforts; and euen whilest we are owners of nothing, it maketh vs lords of all things; whilest we seeme poore, it causeth vs that we be not poore indeed, but only in appearance, seeing thereby we haue a secret ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that the world doth not take notice of, which giueth vs enough, and inableth vs to helpe others. For so the Apostle saith of himselfe, and of other of the faithfull, that they were not simplie poore, but as <hi>it were poore, making many rich; as</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 10.</note>
                  <hi>hauing nothing, and yet possessing all things:</hi> and of such the Wise man speaketh; <hi>There is</hi> (saith he) <hi>that maketh himselfe</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 13. 7.</note>
                  <hi>rich and hath nothing, and that maketh himselfe poore, hauing great riches.</hi> Now this way of inriching a mans selfe in the middest of pouertie is by contentation, as he afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it: <hi>The righteous</hi> (saith he) <hi>eateth to the contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his mind, but the belly of the wicked shall want.</hi> The reason<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nihil interest vtrum non desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deres, an habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as.</hi> Senec. epist. 119.</note> hereof is, because a contented mind borroweth whatsoeuer it wanteth of it selfe; for hauing little it desireth no more, desiring nothing, it wanteth nothing, and he that wanteth nothing, is of all others most rich. Againe, if we be sicke, this content is our best Physition, which both mitigates our paine, and giues vs strength also to beare it; without which euery one is intollerablie sicke in the time of health. Finally, if we be oppressed with cares, this content will free vs from them, by causing vs to cast them vpon the Lord, vpon whom we wholy rest, being assured of his power to helpe vs, and of his will also, by his gratious promises. So the Psalmist saith, <hi>Cast thy burthen vpon the Lord, and he shall helpe thee:</hi> and the<note place="margin">Psalme 55. 22. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Pet. 5. 7.</note> Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> willeth vs <hi>to cast all our care on God, for he careth for vs:</hi> whereas he that wanteth this spirituall contentment in God, is continually tormented with carking care in the middest of all his abundance; for his wealth, though neuer so plentifull, is vnto him as a great standing poole, which
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:10731:264"/> though it haue store of water in it, is subiect to drying vp: whereas the contented mans estate, though neuer so small, is exempted from that feare; seeing it is as a liuing spring, issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from God the fountaine of all goodnesse, which though it be little in quantitie, yet can neuer be quite drie, because it hath a continuall supply whereby it is fed. No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel therefore if he who is richest, is still turmoyled with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care, seeing resting vpon his owne prouision he hath good cause to feare, lest by some great drought of affliction, he may haue his owne ponds of prouision dried vp. Now what doth he but continually want, who is in continuall feare of wanting? In a word, this inward contentment ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs rich without riches, whole without health, warme without clothes, and merrie in our greatest causes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse.</p>

For he is vnhappie, who doth not thinke himselfe happie; he is not rich, who thinketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe poore, and therefore desireth more, although he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse abundance, because his vnsatiable mind swalloweth vp his wealth; he is not honorable, though he were Monarch of the whole world, who thinking himselfe base and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, is discontented in his greatest aduancement. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seeing this contentation is such a pretious iewell, that with it no estate, without it all estates are miserable: let vs labour to attaine vnto it, and not seeke contentment in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, but in our owne minds, for all the world and worldly things cannot bring it to our hearts, vnlesse we first bring contentment vnto them: for as our cloathes cannot giue warmth to our bodies, vnlesse our bodies first giue it vnto them: whereof it is that a dead carcase which hath lost it naturall heate, cannot haue it restored, though all the clothes in the world were laid vpon it: so neither can world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:10731:265"/> things heate the heart with comfort and contentment, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse this spiritual warmth be first from the mind conueighed vnto them, and where this vitall heate is quite wanting, it is not the monarchie of the whole world that will reuiue it. Let vs not therefore seeke for contentment abroad, seeing we may haue it so neere home, not in earthly things, but in our owne hearts, seeing the whole world can neither giue, nor yet take it from vs, which when we haue, miserie it selfe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make vs miserable: we may haue (if we will) sufficient in our owne store; and why then should we depend vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and liue by borrowing, whereby we are brought into a wilfull seruitude? our owne may suffice vs, if our mind suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it selfe: and we may abound in all plentie, if wee be not causes of our owne pouertie: for let vs but inrich our minds with content, and we may well scorne the worlds riches; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the smallest pittance will be sufficient; and enough (as we say) is as good as a feast: we see that sound and healthie bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, though they feed on the coursest fare, are strong, fat and in good liking; whereas those that are diseased, are leane and feeble, though they sit at full tables, and feed only vpon the daintiest food: and therefore no man desireth sicknesse, that he may still feed on delicacies, but would rather content himself with the simplest commons, so he might haue health to beare him companie: so when our minds are in health, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in them that vitall heat of comfort and content in God, we are so strong and vigorous, that in the meanest conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we are replenished with ioy, and though men should take all we haue from vs, yet whether they will or no, they must leaue our chiefe treasure, <hi>content,</hi> behind them: but if we be sicke of worldly concupiscence, nothing will either please or ease vs; and all our delicates will be but loathsome, if they be not serued in with conte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Satan could take away <hi>Iobs</hi> goods but not his comfort, because his content<note place="margin">Iob 1. 21.</note> was not in his outward estate, but in his heart, and hauing no commission to ransacke that, he could not ouercome him in the spirituall fight, seeing though all his riches were gone, his heart supplied wealth enough to maintaine the warre. And though hauing stripped him of all, he should haue had
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:10731:265"/> leaue to haue brought him out to execution, yet his chiefe comforter <hi>content,</hi> would haue accompanied him euen vnto death, seeing it was grounded vpon his affiance and hope in<note place="margin">Iob 13. 15.</note> God, which death it self could not take from him. So though the Amalekits did spoile <hi>Dauid</hi> at once both of his wiues and<note place="margin">1. Sam. 30. 6.</note> wealth, yet his contentment was not taken from him when all outward things failed, because it was not placed in them but in his heart, and in his God; and therefore when for lesse losses his company were so inraged through impatiency, that they were ready to stone him, like fooles and mad men stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king those who are next vnto them, yet affliction being added to affliction, it is said that <hi>Dauid</hi> comforted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the Lord his God. But contrariwise wee see <hi>Ahab</hi> so weakened with his disease of couetousnesse, that hee surfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with the very sight of <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard; and wanting inward content, a whole kingdome could not satisfie him, nor raise or ease his deiected mind, which but an opinion of want had ouerthrowne.</p>
               <p>Would wee therefore haue such contentment as is vnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 5. That we must seeke content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt, not by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying worldly vanities, but by moderating our desires and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi>
                  </note> in the assault of any misery, and as it were out of the gunshot of any danger? let vs seate it chiefly in heauen vnder the protection of Gods prouidence, and so much of it as remaineth with vs, let vs place it in the castle of our harts, which as long as life lasteth none can surprise and spoyle; and not in outward things which easily are stollen away and it with them. For example, would wee haue sufficiencie of honours and worldly glory? why then must wee not with that great enemie of the Romane monarchie, thinke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering one nation after another, that so satisfying our am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, we may in the end find rest, and spend the remainder of our daies in pleasure and delights: for honours are vaine, and doe not satisfie, and the mind is large, and naturally vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable; and therefore here can be no fulnesse and content, for sooner may there want kingdomes to ouercome, then a heart to couet them as wee see in the example of the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an monarch. But this sufficiencie must bee looked for in the mind and heart, not by satisfying, but by moderating and ouerruling them, and not by fitting our estate to our desires;
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:10731:266"/> for they being endlesse, there would be no end of aspiring; but our desires to our estate, being content with that degree of honour which God by lawfull meanes doth call vs vnto; counting it our chiefe honour to contemne those honours, which on ill and vnlawfull conditions are offered vnto vs; and that wee are then truely great, when as wee can despise wicked greatnesse. For seeing the excellencie both of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours themselues, and of their degree and quantity, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth chiefly in mens minds and opinions, and not in any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute goodnesse that is in themselues; therefore hee hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of them indeed, who hath enough in his owne opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and though he be but meanely aduanced, yet if his estate giue contentment to his mind, or rather his mind to it, hee standeth not in need of more preferments, because hee hath as much as he desireth. Whereas if the concupiscence be not ouerruled with reason and religion, the more honours wee haue, the more ambition also; and consequently the lesse content. For seeing all desiring and aspiring commeth from opinion of want, and hee that euer wanteth can neuer bee satisfied; therefore it mattereth not how great our prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in themselues, if we thinke them little vnto vs, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee who thinketh hee hath too little, still affecteth more, and can neuer be content till his owne heart telleth him, that he hath enough. If therefore we would haue contentment in honours, we must not labour to attaine vnto it by multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of preferments, but by moderating our ambition, setting before vs the example of the prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> who being by God himselfe annointed king, did not ambitiously aspire to take possession of the royall throne, by cutting off <hi>Saul,</hi> though he were reiected by God, but waited till the Lord himselfe did make him a way, by giuing vnto him lawfull meanes: and when hee was highest in his estate hee was not haughty in his heart, but was as humble as a wained child, when he welded the scepter, and held in his hand soueraigne power, whereby hauing his mind farre vnder his condition, though through his sonnes ambition hee lost his kingdome, yet not his content, but was willing to accept of any estate which the Lord would assigne vnto him. <hi>Here am I</hi> (saith he)
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:10731:266"/>
                  <hi>let him doe to me as seemeth good in his eyes.</hi> And this was that<note place="margin">2. Sam. 15. 26.</note> lesson which our Sauiour taught his Disciples, when as they ambitiously stroue one with another who should be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test; not to satisfie their ambition by supplanting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or attaining vnto preferments, but to subdue their pride, and moderate their concupiscence, becomming as meeke<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 3. 4.</note> and humble as those little children which hee set before them.</p>
               <p>And thus also must we looke for sufficiencie of riches, not<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. If we would haue content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, we must lay aside co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse.</hi>
                  </note> in our outward estate, but in our mind; not by adding to our wealth, but by diminishing our concupiscence: for though the world may thinke it a strange paradox, yet it is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, that a man is made truely rich, not by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, but by substraction; not by encreasing his riches, but by abating his immoderate desires. For seeing the whole riches of the world are finite, and the mind of man in some sort infinite and vnsatiable; therefore there can be no fulnes or sufficiencie by fitting riches to our minds, which is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; but by limiting and circumscribing our desires and concupiscence, making them so little as that they may bee satisfied, seeing the other can neuer be so great, as to fill and satisfie them in their full largenesse. And if wee thus confine our vnlimited desires with true content, we shall attaine vnto greater and better riches, then the whole world can yeeld, for that may giue vs much, but not enough, and where there is not enough there is want, and he that wanteth is stil poore, seeing penurie and pouerty goe together; but content brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth sufficiencie to the meanest estate, and hee that hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie wanteth nothing, and hee who wanteth nothing is aboue all others truely rich. And thus the Apostle prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth a way how a christian may bee rich, and neuer neede to seeke helpe from the earthly mammon: <hi>Godlinesse</hi> (saith hee)<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>is great riches, with contentation.</hi> So that a man may bee rich without riches, when godlines and contentation do meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And to the same purpose one of the ancient well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fineth riches: Those (saith he) are true and neuer wasting ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Gen. 16.

Hee therefore who is indued with Gods spirituall graces, godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and contentation, is truely rich, though his outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, be neuer so meane; and of him that may be truely said, which the spirit speaketh to the Angell of the Church of Smyrna; <hi>I know thy pouerty, but thou art rich.</hi> For hee onely is rich in Gods estimate, who is rich vnto eternity, laying vp in store the fruits, not of earthly abundance but of vertue: he which hath such peace and tranquillity of mind, that hee desireth nothing, nor is tossed with the waues of concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence, neither loathing his old store, nor seeking new, by perpetuall desiring, making himselfe poore in abundance of wealth. The onely way therefore to attaine sufficiencie of riches, is to haue in all estates a contented mind; for thus we may be rich in the middest of pouerty, seeing he is rich who hath enough, and he hath enough whose state agreeth with<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Non qui parum habet, sed qui plus cupit pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per est.</hi> Senec.</note> his mind; neither is hee poore who hath little, but hee who not being sufficed desireth more. Whereas if wee want this contentment, though we haue neuer so great store of wealth, yet we remaine poore; neither can it by satisfying our minds make vs happie, but onely change our miserie, making vs now want in plenty, who before wanted through penury. And this commeth to passe because our minds continuing sicke and diseased with discontent, which ariseth from their insatiety, doe make riches as troublesome, and more burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some vnto vs then our pouerty. For as hee who is sicke of the dropsie is alike tormented with vnsatiable thirst, whether he drinke in siluer plate, or in earthen pots; and he who is sicke of a feuer is alike ill at ease, when he lieth in a bed of iuorie, and when he lieth in a bed of wood; because wheresoeuer he doth lie his disease followeth him: so if our minds bee sicke of couetousnesse, it mattereth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> to be found in outward things, which only satiate and neuer satisfie, but in the inward contentation of the mind, which we may easily attaine vnto, if we change our carnall delights into spirituall reioycing in God, in the fruition of his spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all graces, and in our assurance of his heauenly ioyes; for this will make our hearts so inwardly cheerefull, that we shall take pleasure in all outward things, not onely such as the world delighteth in, but also in those which are tedious and troublesome vnto them: for this inward pleasure will turne our labours into recreations, and our sorrowes into ioy, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vs to be merrie and reioyce, not onely in worldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie, but also in tribulatiō, as the Apostle teacheth vs, both by his <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 5. 3.</note> doctrine and <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 16. 25.</note> example: and this is that ioy, which as our Sauiour Christ saith, is <note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 15. 11.</note> full, and therefore satisfieth<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 4.</note> vs, and permanent, and therefore can neuer be taken from vs. But if besides this spirituall ioy, we would be satisfied with worldly pleasures, we must not looke for this sufficiencie in outward things, but in our minds, not by multiplying our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, but by restraining our appetites: for otherwise well may we be glutted, but neuer contented with worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, like the arch-epicure himselfe, who confessed that loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<note place="margin">Epicurus apud Stobaeum. lib. 1. serm. 17.

               <p>And thus haue I shewed that the only meanes of attaining<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 8. The first and</hi>

The first and principall meanes of attaining vnto contentation, is wholly to resigne our selues ouer to the good will and pleasure of God, submitting our willes vnto his will, and saying with our Sauiour Christ, <hi>not my will, but thine be done:</hi> the which howsoeuer it be an<note place="margin">Matth. 26. 39.</note> hard lesson to flesh and blood, yet may we easily learne it, if we know, and knowing beleeue; first that the Lord vpon whom we wholly rely is infinit in wisdome, and therefore knoweth much better what is good and profitable for vs, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially for the eternal sauing of our souls, thē we our selues; for if the child taketh no care for himself, but resteth conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with that prouision &amp; allowance which his louing father allotteth to him, because he knoweth that his fathers discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion exceedeth his; and if being sick, we be content to receiue vpon the Physitiōs word, not only those things which we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but euen bitter pils and vnpleasing potions, which we loath &amp; abhor, because we know, his skil exceeding ours, he is much better able to direct vs for the recouery of our health: then how much rather should we lay aside care, and rely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the allowance of our heauenly Father? how much rather should we trust this spiritual Physition, whose skill and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes neuer failed? We in our foolish appetite desire world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honors, but he in his wisdome denieth them, because he knoweth they are but windie meats, which would not nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish our soules, but puffe vs vp with pride; we affect worldly riches, but he withholdeth them, because he well seeth they would be a meanes to make vs poore in grace, and as vnfit to enter into the straite and low gate of heauen, as the Camell into the needles eye; we dote vpon carnall pleasures, but he withholdeth them from vs, because he knoweth that our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corous and greedie appetites would easily surfet of them, and so lose our spirituall health and strength, if not our bodily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: and therefore why should we not be contented to want these things, which if they would not bring more hurt then
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:10731:268"/> good, more losse then profit, our heauenly Father, and most cunning Physition would neuer haue denied them vnto vs. And this argument our Sauiour Christ vseth to remoue car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care, and worke contentation, because our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 32.</note> knoweth better then our selues of what wee stand in need. Secondly, let vs consider, that as he best knoweth what is fit for vs, so he is omnipotent, and therefore most able to supplie it; and as he can giue riches without contentment, so also is he alike able to giue content without riches; for it is he himselfe rather then his gifts, that doth <hi>satiate the heauie</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ierem. 31. 25.</note>
                  <hi>soule, and replenisheth the sorrowfull soule with ioy,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet speaketh. And these two things knowne and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, may make vs rest with content vpon his abilitie to doe vs good; for if hee knoweth what is best for vs, and hath power also to giue it, who can doubt of his sufficiencie? But though he be God all-sufficient, and therefore able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for vs, yet how may we rest assured that he will doe it? Surely this is no lesse certaine then the other; first, because his loue towards vs is infinite, as being our gratious Father in Christ, who hath loued vs so dearely, that he hath giuen<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 16.</note> vnto vs and for vs, his only beloued Sonne, and that to suffer for vs death, euen that bitter and shamefull death of the crosse, that he might worke the worke of our redemption; and thus he loued vs, not when we were friends and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">Coloss. 1. 21.</note> but strangers and enemies. From whence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with the Apostle, that he who hath giuen vnto vs his Sonne, when we were in the state of emnity, cannot possiblie<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> deny any thing which is good for vs to receiue, seeing we are now reconciled and become his friends. Secondly, his will is manifested by his manifold and gratious promises, whereby he hath vndertaken to minister vnto vs all things that are good; so the Plalmist saith, that if we <hi>feare the Lord, there is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalme 34. 9.</note>
                  <hi>nothing that is good shall be wanting vnto vs;</hi> and that the Lord <hi>our God is our sunne and shield, who giueth grace and glorie, and withholdeth no good thing from them that walke vprightly.</hi> Our Sauiour likewise hath promised vs, that if we first seeke the<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 33.</note> kingdome of God and his righteousnesse, all outward things also shal be ministred vnto vs. And the Apostle telleth vs that
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:10731:269"/> we ought to be content with those things which we haue,<note place="margin">Hebr. 13. 5.</note> because the Lord hath promised that he will not faile vs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forsake vs; if he had promised his gifts and not himselfe, there might be cause of discontent, when they are wanting; as for example, if he had promised only honors, riches, and pleasures of the world, and said that these should neuer faile, we should haue had little comfort or content in our disgrace, pouertie and bitter griefes, because all these things haue left vs; but when he promiseth vs himselfe, that he will neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake vs, we can neuer haue iust cause of discontent; because what is wanting in our outward estate, he is readie to supply by his inward graces, and able to make our little sufficient, as well as plentie, and euen our nothing as good as all things.</p>
               <p>Seeing then our God in whom we trust, is so infinit in wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 9. That Christians may safely and securely rest on Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
                  </note> and power, so infinit also in his loue towards vs, and no lesse gratious in his promises, then true in performance, as being truth it selfe, who cannot deceiue, and his words, Yea and Amen: what foule shame were it for vs who professe Christianitie, and by often instruction haue attained to the knowledge of these principles; not to rely our selues wholly vpon him with full content, submitting our willes vnto his will, and liking of that which best pleaseth him, seeing the very heathens, who were ignorant of this trust, and destitute<note place="margin">

Neither in truth can there be a more effectuall argument, to moue vs vnto conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of mind, and to beare whatsoeuer befalleth vs with patience and comfort, then to consider, that God, who is in himselfe infinite in wisedome and knowledge, and vnto vs most gratious and mercifull, doth so order and gouerne all things with his prouidence, that not so much as a sparrow can light on the ground, or an haire fall from our head, but as
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:10731:269"/> they are guided by it. Whereof it is that our Sauiour Christ<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> persuading vs to lay aside carking care, &amp; to rest wholly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God with contentation of mind, doth chiefly insist vpon this reason, as being most powerfull and effectuall. For if there be no doubt to bee made either of Gods ability, or of his loue; and if we certainely know that by his wise, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and most gracious prouidence, he appointeth, directeth and gouerneth al things whatsoeuer, which happē vnto vs, or any way concerne vs: then must we also necessarily conclude, that all that befalleth vs is for the best; and that the calling, state and condition wherein wee liue, though in it selfe it may seeme euill and full of miserie, and were in truth so as it seemeth, vnto other men, yet vnto vs it is of all others most good and profitable, seeing it is appointed and allotted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by God, whose infinite wisedome, power, truth, and loue would haue disposed otherwise of vs, had he not known this estate most fitting for vs; and would not haue denied vnto vs any thing which our hearts desire, but that hee kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that they would doe vs more hurt then good, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, rather then further the eternall saluation of our soules. So the Psalmist telleth vs, that those who feare the Lord shall want nothing; the which he limiteth and restraineth in the<note place="margin">Psal. 34. 9. 10.</note> next verse, because we are ready to make our concupiscence, and not reason and truth, the measure of our wants, telling vs that they shall not want any thing which is good; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if God should bestow vpon vs those things which hee knoweth would be hurtfull vnto vs, though they be good in their owne nature, they would be euill vnto vs, and through<note place="margin">Psal. 16. 6. <hi>Si nosti quod propter curam quam de nobis habet Deus, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis largitus est, illud quoque intelligas quod propter eandem curam mensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram tribuit.</hi> Chrysost. in 1. Cor. 12. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 29.</note> our abuse, of benefits become curses. And therefore whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer our condition or portion is, wee may safely conclude, that it is best for vs, and say with the Prophet <hi>Dauid, the lines are fallen vnto me in pleasant places, yea I haue a goodly he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage;</hi> praising the Lord for that we haue, and not murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for that we haue not. For if wee know that for the care and loue which God beareth vs, hee hath giuen vnto vs that we haue; let vs know also that in the same care and loue hee hath measured vnto vs our proportion, which should make vs reioyce in those things which we haue receiued, and not
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:10731:270"/> breake out into impatiencie, because something we desire is withheld from vs; yea seeing the Lord keepeth nothing from vs, but such things as he knoweth would be tentations vnto sinne, let vs glorie in these wants, and giue thanks to God, that we haue not more gifts then grace to vse them, nor receiued a burthen aboue our strength.</p>
               <p>Yea will some say, but I see others whō God loueth abound<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 10. The reasons why the Lord giueth worldly things to some of his children and not to others.</hi>
                  </note> in honours, riches and delights, who notwithstanding serue God faithfully, and imploy these gifts which they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, to the glory of him from whom they haue receiued them; and why might not I also enioying them be bettered and not hurt by them as well as they? I answere, that all are not of the like nature and temper, but as wee say, so many men, so many minds; by reason wherof it commeth to passe, that ones food is anothers poyson, one mans raising is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ruine, and that which is most profitable for this man, is for another most pernicious. There is no wise physition gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the same physicke to all patients, or in the same propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but he fitteth it in quantitie and quality to euery ones neede, giuing one pils to purge him, another cordials to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him; one must bee launched, another must bee healed; one must haue sauces to quicken his appetite, another must fast, and be cured by abstinence. Neither is there any wise housholder that particularly knowing the condition of his familie, will prouide for, and feed all with like food, or with equall quantity; for one loueth that which another loatheth, and this man ariseth hungrie with that allowance, which would cause another to surfet with excesse. And doest thou denie vnto God that liberty of disposing vnto euery one that which best befitteth them, when as thou allowest it vnto men? Shall the physition order his patients as hee pleaseth, who often faileth in skill, and sometime in faithfulnesse; and shall not the Lord be allowed to purge or restore, wound or bind vp, cautherize or heale, as hee knoweth most fitting for his seuerall patients, seeing hee can neither erre in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor faile in loue? Shall the housholder haue leaue to dispose of his owne goods in his owne family, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing may be short in discretion, or partiall in affection;
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:10731:270"/> and must the Lord bee stinted, so as hee may not giue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his pleasure that allowance to euery one which hee knoweth most requisite, seeing his wisedome is infinite and his loue incomprehensible, respecting the person of none, but doing good to all, as their state and condition doth require? We find by experience that one man is bettered by liberty, another by restraint. One being of an ingenuous nature, is made better by benefits, another of a more seruile dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on becommeth worse, and is onely mended with threats and punishments: vpon the one kindnesse worketh, vpon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feare. This man is fit for imployment when he hath well fed, another is so drowsie that he is good for nothing but to sleepe. Now who is most fit to iudge of thy nature and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and accordingly to allot vnto thee the most fitting proportion? Thou, who being blinded with pride and selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue<note place="margin">Ier. 17. 10.</note> ouerweenest thy gifts, and thinkest thou couldest well beare a saile, which in truth would ouerturne thee; or God,<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 24.</note> who hauing made thee of nothing searcheth the heart and raines, and plainely seeth all thy secret thoughts and hidden imaginations, notwithstanding all those vailes which selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue hath cast ouer them? Thou desirest honours, but God knoweth that pride lurking in thy heart, would if thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest them, make thee insolent and the more ambitious; thou wouldest wallow in worldly delights, but God knoweth that thou wouldest dote so much vpō them, that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest neglect the ioyes of heauen; thou wishest to bee rich in goods, but God knoweth they would make thee poore in godlinesse: thou desirest health and strength, but God seeth they would make thy soule sicke and weake, causing thee to bee the more secure, and to put the day of repentance farre from thee. And therefore the Lord giueth thee contempt for honour to make thee humble, and fit by stooping to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the gates of heauen; he giueth thee miseries for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, that being weaned from the world thou maiest hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger after his eternall ioyes: in stead of riches, hee giueth thee pouerty, that thy heart being empty of worldly vanities, may be filled with his graces; and for health hee giueth thee sicknesse, that thou maiest daily cast vp thine accounts, and
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:10731:271"/> be alwaies ready when hee calleth for thee to giue a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thy stewardship.</p>
               <p>Yea but the Lord if he would, might haue made mee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 11. The reasons why the Lord maketh not all his children rich in all worldly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</hi>
                  </note> and humble, rich and gracious too, he might haue giuen me abundance of his gifts, and a mind also to vse them well; and seeing others haue both, why haue not I as well as they? But who art thou O man who disputest with God! should the pot say to the potter, why hast thou made me thus? Though there were no other reason why thou hast not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued these double gifts of prosperity and grace, but Gods sole will, it were sufficient to satisfie vs, seeing they are his free and vndeserued gifts, which he may iustly bestow where he pleaseth. For may he not doe with his owne what he will? or is our eye euill because he is good? Is it not enough for vs to be seruants of his familie, vnles we be stewards and chiefe officers? should we not rather be thankfull for receiuing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny benefits, then repine because wee haue not receiued all? doth it not suffice vs that we are made partakers of his chiefe iewels, and are adopted sonnes and heires of our eternall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie; vnlesse wee haue also seruants wages, and a large share in earthly trifles? and can we not bee content that the Lord hath giuen vs leaue to goe to heauen, if wee may not also chuse our way? But consider further that thou art not scanted of any thing thou desirest, because the Lord is nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly in his gifts; for his bounty was such, that had it not been our owne fault, wee might haue been partakers of all: for in our first creation he gaue vs grace and glory, vertue and happinesse, abundance of his blessings, and holy wisedome and pure affections whereby we were enabled rightly to vse them. But by our fall in the loines of our first parents, wee brought our selues into the state of corruption, whereby wee lost all right both to spirituall graces and worldly blessings; and are wee not well though for a while wee haue not both, if the better part be restored vnto vs? By our sinne we haue so disordered Gods blessings, and diuided his gifts, that very seldome his spirituall graces and temporall benefits will rest together, vnlesse by the supernaturall and admirable worke of his holy spirit they bee reconciled: and would wee daily
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:10731:271"/> haue God to doe miracles by ioyning the height of pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and the height of grace, and as it were heauen and earth in the same subiect? Againe, consider that in this state of corruption, for the preseruing of humane society, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie that there should bee some of meane quality, as well as honourable, poore as rich, weake as well as strong; and why should any thinke that the condition wherin God hath placed him, is not as fit for him as for another? for wherein hath he deserued better at Gods hands that hee should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre him? or what hath hee that hee hath not receiued? or why should any desire all, when as vpon examinatinon hee shall find that he deserueth nothing? Furthermore, if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Lord, the more to manifest the glory of his wisedom and power, to cast vs first downe whom hee meaneth to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance; to make contemptible, whom hee purposeth to make glorious; to afflict with pouerty and miserie, whom hee intendeth to inrich with eternall happinesse, and to bring vs to heauen as it were by hell gates; why should wee not willingly follow him euen in the foulest way that will bring vs to the faire iourneies end of ioy and blessednesse? Finally, let vs remember that the world was not made for our para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, where we should haue all ioy without sorrow, and good without the mixture of any euill; but for our pilgrimage, where for sinne we should be afflicted, tried and proued, that so through Gods free mercy being found fit, wee might bee receiued into our heauenly countrie, and there inioy our happinesse and fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Lastly, let vs consider, that God in his kingdome hath seuerall rewards, though the same blessednesse, and as it were crownes of glory, of diuers makings. Hee hath one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and crowne for the patient poore, and another for the bountifull rich; one for them who are humbly honourable, and another for them who are couragious in contempt; one for them who doe well, and another for those that suffer for well doing; measuring his rewards according to the measure of his gifts and graces: why therefore should wee not desire to haue all fitted? why should we not bee content with any so we may be sure of one? why should we not with patience
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:10731:272"/> and cheerefulnesse suffer heere want, that there we may haue fulnesse; miserie that we may find ioy; pouerty that we may be inriched with these treasures; and ignominie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, that we may receiue this crowne of glory. And this argument of comfort and contentation our Sauiour Christ vseth: for hauing persuaded his disciples to relie on Gods prouidence without carking care, and promised that if they<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 32.</note> would seeke first Gods kingdome and righteousnesse, they should haue also worldly necessaries supplied vnto them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were like to haue some small discouragement by their short allowance of these dersied benefits, hee willeth them not to feare for al this, because it was their fathers plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to giue them a kingdome.</p>
               <p>The next meanes to attaine vnto contentation, is to liue<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 12 The 2. meanes of contentment is to leade a godly life.</hi> 1. Tim. 6. 6.</note> an holy and christian life, walking in the waies of Gods commandements, in sincerity and vprightnesse of heart; for first godlinesse must enrich vs, before we can be content with that wee haue: first God must dwell with vs by his spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee can be content to forbeare the worlds companie. Our hearts must be filled with better things, before wee can be willing to part with worse; they must bee inriched with heauenly treasures, before wee will leaue immoderate see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of earthly trash; they must be indued with knowledge, faith, affiance, hope, loue and the rest of Gods sanctifying graces, before they can lightly esteeme of honours, riches, and earthly delights: for hauing a naturall appetite and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring desires, either they must bee filled and satisfied with that which is good, or else they will with vnsatiable longing affect and couet worldly vanities; like the stomacke, which vnlesse it be sufficed with wholesome food, will sucke in the wind, though being full of it it is not satisfied, but rather tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. Againe, if wee haue any true contentment we must haue it in the Lord, as hath been shewed; but there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to be had in God without godlinesse: for howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the Lord be infinite in wisedome, power, goodnes, loue, and truth, yet we cannot comfortablie apply any of al this to our selues, for our vse &amp; benefit; neither in truth do they at al appertaine vnto vs, vnlesse we performe such conditions as
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:10731:272"/> God requireth, louing, fearing, trusting in, and seruing him in simplicity, sincerity, and vprightnesse of heart; seeing the Lord hath limited the promises of all his mercies to such as obserue them. So the Psalmist saith, that nothing shall bee<note place="margin">Psal. 34. 9. 10. and 37. 4. and 84. 11.</note> wanting which is good to those who seeke the Lord and feare him; that if we delight in the Lord he will giue vs our hearts desire, that the Lord will bee a sunne and shield, giue grace and glory, and withhold no good thing from them that walke vprightly. So the wise man telleth vs it is the good conscience which makes a continual feast; and y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it is the feare<note place="margin">Pro. 15. 15. 16.</note> of the Lord, which being put into the skole with a little, waigheth downe in worth and waight all worldly riches and abundance. Finally, our Sauiour Christ telleth vs▪ that wee shall haue from God a supplie of all earthly necessaries; but<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 33.</note> it is vpon the condition, that we first seeke his kingdome and righteousnesse. Those therefore who performe these duties which God requireth, may with comfort and contentation of mind rest securely vpon his prouidence and promises, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue assured interest and title vnto them; and they may ioyfully submit their willes vnto his, taking all hee sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in good part, seeing his mercies are sweet, and his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements wholesome, and all whatsoeuer being foreseene and directed by his wisedome, ruled by his prouidence, and applied vnto vs in loue, must needs turne to our good, and further our saluation. Whereas contrariwise those who li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Lastly, if wee would haue contentation in all estates, wee<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 13. The 3. meanes is to thinke of our benefits as well as of our wants.</hi>
                  </note> must as well haue an eye vpon those things which through Gods mercy we enioy, as vpon those things which we want; and thinke as well what we deserue, as what we desire. For if we would consider that in our greatest wants we inioy innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable

Againe, if we would but consider how many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits we inioy which others want, who are much more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie; if we would looke how many come behind vs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that go far before vs in desert; we would not through discontent make our selues miserable, because we cannot be so happie as we desire; we would not fret because some go before vs, but reioyce that we are preferred before so many; nor repiningly thinke Gods liberalitie scant and strait, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we haue not all, but rather admire and thankfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll his infinit bounty, that he vouchsafeth vnto vs any thing, who haue deserued nothing: whereas if our finger be alwaies vpon our sores, and our eye vpon our wants, neuer thinking what we haue, but what we desire; if we alwaies looke vpon those who go before vs, and neuer cast backe our eye vpon those that follow vs; if we compare our wants with others plentie, and our miseries with their ioyes; neuer looking at that wherein they also are defectiue, nor vpon those euils, wherein they haue their share; then can we neuer want sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and discontent, because we are our owne tormenters, nor liue at ease with comfort and quietnesse, seeing we picke quarrels against our owne peace, and whip our selues with rods of our owne making.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I shewed that our contentment is to be<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 14. That perfect and full conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is only to be found in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly happines.</hi>

And therefore if we be once certaine of these ioyes, though it be but by the assurance of faith and hope, we shall not mourne with discontent in the absence of worldly vanities, seeing we shall want them no more, if once this diuine brightnesse hath illuminated our hearts, then we want the candle light when the Sun shineth. Now if we would attaine vnto this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of these heauenly ioyes, we must make Christ our way, for none climeth thither but by this <note n="a" place="margin">Iohn 1. 12. 51.</note> ladder, and by a liuely faith be ingrafted into him, that so in him being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, iustified and adopted, we may being <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 8. 15. 17.</note> sons, be also heires of euerlasting happinesse; as also we must shew the fruits of our faith in sanctification of life, seeing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures plainely teach vs, that if wee bee not <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> sanctified, we are not iustified, and if we be not iustified, we shall neuer be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that without <note n="d" place="margin">Hebr. 12. 14.</note> holinesse we shall neuer see God, that <note n="e" place="margin">Apoc. 21. 27.</note> nothing vncleane shall enter in thither, and that vnlesse we be <note n="f" place="margin">Iohn 3. 3.</note> regenerate and borne againe, we can neuer enter into the kingdome of heauen: and therefore if we would be citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the kingdome of glorie, we must first passe thorow the suburbs of grace; we must do God seruice, if we expect to receiue <note n="g" place="margin">Matth 20. 4.</note> wages; and <note n="h" place="margin">Apocal. 3. 21.</note> ouercome the spirituall enemies of

It is true indeed that they who abound in wealth haue fit opportunity and meanes of doing the workes of mercy and of comforting and doing good vnto many, but this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge they haue aboue the poore, onely in manifesting the bountie and goodnesse of their mind vnto men, for both are alike and equally accepted in the sight of God, the rich man who doth good deeds both with heart and hand, and the poore man, who wanting ability, is onely bountifull in his affection, and willing desire.</p>
               <p>Now if this be true of those rich men, who by their vse of<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. That riches are most vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to sordidous misers.</hi>

For whilest they thinke of gathering and scraping more and more, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to enioy that they haue, and so of masters become only iaylors and keepers of their wealth, hauing no vse of it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, nor letting others vse it; wherby it commeth to passe, that of all they haue they haue nothing, and yet are tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the want of all which they haue not. So that these are like him who was possessed with that vnrulie diuell, or rather legion of wicked spirits, for this diuell of sordidous<note place="margin">Luk. 8. 27.</note> couetousnesse, will not suffer them to dwell in their houses, because they would not lose the hire; nor to eate meate, or weare their clothes, because they require cost, and hinder their bags from filling; but causeth them in franticke maner to breake all bonds of common honesty, to toile and trauell by sea and land, to runne a thousand desperate courses, and to wound their heads with cares, and their harts with griefe, whilest they are drawne on with hope to encrease their wealth, and when with all this care and danger they haue attained to their desires, they haue no vse or benefit of all
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:10731:276"/> that which with so great paine and perill they haue scraped together. Like vnto them who being athirst, spend all their time in drawing water, and in filling their cisternes, but yet haue no power to drinke, though all their vessels doe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow; wherein they commit that miserable follie which the<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 20. 21.</note> rich foole in the Gospell fell into, who though he had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all things, yet neuer thought of inioying any thing till he was ready to leaue all, bidding then his soule to liue at ease, to eate, drinke, and take it pleasure, when as in the very same night it was taken from him.

And as <hi>Moses</hi> onely saw the land of Canaan, but for his sinne was not permitted to haue any share or portion in it: so they haue for their miserable couetousnesse this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment by God inflicted on them▪ that they shall onely see their goods with their eyes, but neuer inioy them for their comfort▪ and that they shall coile and moile for their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, oftentimes they not knowing who hee shall bee, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no maner of benefit by their owne labours, but as pipes keepe none of the water to themselues that runneth through them, but conueigh all to their cisternes; so they are not able to retaine any of the goods which they possesse, for their owne benefit and comfort, but onely serue as ouerseers to conuey them to their heires; who for the reward of all their painefull labour, doe whilest they liue grudge them their liues, as they grudge themselues all the comforts of life; and doe not so much loue them because they shall hereafter receiue much by their care and prouision, as loath and hate them, because already they haue not receiued it; they stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in their way, and keeping from them that which they so much couet.

And this the wise <hi>Salomon</hi> teacheth vs by his owne experience, for hauing sought to please himselfe with all manner of delights, and demed no ioy to his heart which it could desire, concludeth at last that he could find no profit in any of them, but vanitie and vexation of spirit. If<note place="margin">Eccles. 2. 1. 10. 11.</note> therfore he who had al the delights which a great kingdom, a peaceable and prosperous raigne, and abundance of all worldly plessings, were able to yeeld vnto him, could not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had tried many conclusions, to giue his heart ioy and pleasure, find any profit in any of them: how vnprofitable are our delights like to proue, who want these plentifull meanes wherin he abounded, and haue all our comforts crossed with many miseries, from which he was priuiledged? But if we would further consider, that that alone is to be esteemed tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profitable, which doth profit vs in our place and calling, and aduanceth the maine ends at which we aime, we should plainly perceiue how little profit there is in pleasure: for we are called to the state of Christianitie, to be the seruants and children of God, and the maine end which we propound in all our doings and proceedings, is to glorifie God in our owne saluation, to finish our course with ioy, and to passe the time of our pilgrimage so in Gods feare, as that in the end of our liues we may arriue at our heauenly countrie, and inherit those eternall ioyes. But alas how little do worldly pleasures (especially when they are too much esteemed and affected) in these respects profit vs? How slenderly doe they aduance these ends and further vs in this way; yea rather how much do they endamage vs, and either slacken our pace or quite hinder vs in this spirituall race? whilest being so besotted on these earthly delights, we neuer think of our heauenly ioyes, or spend that precious time in vaine sports, wherein we should labour to furnish our hearts with Gods spirituall and sauing graces, and attaine vnto certaine assurance that we haue our part and interest in that eternall happinesse; or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, whilest being pampered with these worldly pleasures,

                  <hi>his waies, though he be rich.</hi> They do not make vs better in our selues, for seeing they are not any way essentiall vnto vs, but outward accidents, we haue nothing added to our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, when we haue them, nor any thing diminished, when we want them; that which truly maketh vs better, bettereth our being, and addeth some perfection to our essence; now whereas we haue a double being, one by generation as men, another by regeneration as Christians, the excellencie of the former consisteth in the perfection of reason, and of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in true godlinesse; and therefore seeing these outward things neither make vs more reasonable, nor yet more godly and religious, they do not at all make vs better, our goodnes
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:10731:279"/> consisting in those things which they further not: if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we excell in the vse of reason, and in the knowledge and practise of true religion, our goodnesse is not impaired when all these faile vs; but if we be defectiue in them, and be either foolish men, or lame and bastardly Christians, these outward ornaments will be but like gay hangings on rotten and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken walles, which commend vs to the sight and view of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but doe not better vs in our selues, by stopping our breaches, and repairing our ruines: and as those who are sicke of the dropsie, seeme fat and in good liking to those who are farre off; whereas it plainly appeareth to those who look vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them neerer hand, that their beautie proceedeth not from the good habitude of their bodies, but from their fulnesse of humors, which is the true cause of their disease: so those who abound with these outward things, may seeme better and more happie then others, to those that view them at the first sight, but those who better consider of them, easily find that it is but a diseased beauty which commendeth them, &amp; that they are not in truth bettered by all these things, but rather the diseases and spirituall sicknesses of their soules increased, and made more desperate and vncurable. Let vs not therfore account our selues bettered by these outward things, for thē our goods and goodnesse will both at once faile vs, but by those things in which our excellencie consisteth, and which being in vs, and peculiar to our selues, do make vs iustly to be preferred before al other creatures. We know that a player is not better then his fellowes, because he acteth a Kings part, seeing all his excellencie is in his outward habite, and nothing in his person, and if another acteth his part better, he is preferred farre before him, though he sustaine the meanest and basest personage, because his worth is measured, not by his gay cloathes, but by his excellencie in his owne facultie and profession. A surgeon is not commended because he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in braue apparel, but for his great skill in curing wounds; and the scholler is not magnified for his faire house, or full chests, but for his excellencie in all maner of knowledge and learning: neither is the Pilot praised, because he hath a faire ship gilt with gold and well rigged, but for his skill in naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:10731:279"/> and care in vsing all his knowledge for the good of the passengers. And thus also it is in other creatures; for the Vine is not praised for it faire leaues, straight body, and good timber; but for it fruitfulnes in bearing good and pleasant grapes: neither is the horse bettered by his rich saddle, and golden trappings, seeing his goodnes consisteth not in these things which may at night bee taken from him, but in his shape, strength, soundnesse, good pace, and sure trauelling. And so the excellency and goodnesse of a christian consisteth not in these outward things, as honours, riches, pleasures, but in the fruits of godlinesse, which hee oftentimes beareth better, and in greater abundance when as hee is pruned, and these outward superfluities taken away; not in his gay habit and rich furniture, but in his swiftnesse and surenesse in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the spirituall race, which hee commonly best perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth when hee is lightened and vnloaded of this worldly brauerie. If these earthly things would serue to enrich our soules with Gods spirituall graces, if they would purchase Christ, and procure for vs the rich robes of his righteousnes;<note place="margin">

Neither<note place="margin">Act. 3. 8.</note> doe they inable vs to make our christian profession in the time of danger, or imbolden vs to suffer for the testimonie of the truth, nay rather wee are most cowardly in performing these duties, when we most abound with these earthly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and when honour and riches are silent for feare of losse, pouerty and meannesse make a bold profession: whilest <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> a great ruler stealeth to Christ by night, the poore fishermen follow him at noone day.

For without these he is bettered only in place, and not in person; and hauing aspired to that height, not by vertue and desert, but by the vanity and proud ambition of his heart, his highnesse of place may rather be ascribed to his vaine lightnesse, then to his solid goodnesse, euen as the chaffe lieth higher then the wheat▪ because it is lighter, and not because it is better. Neither are wee made better by worldly riches in those respects wherin we are chiefly good, because these are inward and spirituall, and those externall and accidentall; in regard whereof one truely saith, that those who not hauing in them any good parts or selfe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, doe measure their goodnesse by their goods, are like vnto a pennie purse full of money, which hath all it worth<note place="margin">Master Greenham.</note> from that which it containeth; and therefore is contemned

Do we not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally see with our owne eyes, that it is not those who are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced to the highest honours, nor those who abound in wealth, and wallow themselues in worldly delights, that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the schoole of vertue and godlinesse, the Church and house of God; or if they do, are so apt to learne spirituall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and to profit in the knowledge of Gods sauing truth; but those who are of meane condition, poore estate, and afflicted with worldly crosses? so as it may be truly said, that those who go on foot, yea those who are old and decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite, sicke, lame, and blind, do make more diligent speed, and go much faster to the Church of God, the spirituall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place of our soules, wherein they are furnished with all vertues and sauing graces; then those who ride on their foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathes, and are swiftly hurried in their gilded coaches, or they who haue best health, most strength, and the greatest share in all manner of worldly happinesse. And therefore as sobrietie and abstinence preserue our bodily health, and help to free vs from those diseases which come of fulnesse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion; so the want or sparing vse of these worldly things
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:10731:282"/> preserues the health of our soules, making them strong and vigorous in grace and vertue; whereas the glutting satietie of earthly vanities corrupts the mind, abates our spirituall strength, and filles vs full of the corrupt humors of vice and sinne.</p>
               <p>And as they do not helpe to sow in vs inwardly the seeds<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. That worldly things do not make vs more fruitfull in good workes.</hi>
                  </note> of grace, so neither do they cause vs to bring forth outwardly the fruits of godlines: for howsoeuer the ambitious man hath attained vnto honors and preferments, wherby he is enabled to defend the weake and to shelter the poore vnder the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his protection: yet either is his mind so wholly taken vp with his purposes and plots of rising, that he hath no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to thinke of the poore, or scorneth to haue his thoughts fixed on such meane subiects, or finding some strong opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, dare not be seene in the poore mans cause, lest crossing his compeeres in their will, they should crosse him in his next preferment; or finally, so spendeth his whole state in bribes, and wearieth all his friends in his owne suits, for his further aduancement, that he hath neither will, leasure, nor meanes to do good vnto any in distresse, nor to releeue the necessities of those that are afflicted. So likewise they who set their harts vpon pleasures, though they abound in superfluitie, yet are they most poore in charitie, and in the workes of mercie; for as they exceed in wealth, so also in riot and excesse, and all they can rake together is little enough to minister to their voluptuousnes, and to consume in pleasures: yea so wholly are they set on their delights, that they had rather spend ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pounds in feasts and banquetting, in maskes and shewes, sports and pastimes, then to giue a few shillings towards the reliefe of a poore Christian; and can more willingly find in their hearts, that many should perish for want of food, then to abate the least part of their pleasure, or denie vnto their neuer satisfied soules any one delight. Finally, if a man set his heart vpon the earthly Mammon, though hee abound in wealth, yet is hee sure to bee most poore in good workes, though he flow in the plentie of meanes, whereby he is ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to do good, and to exercise his bountie in the workes of mercie, yet are his fruits and good works at the lowest ebbe,
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:10731:282"/> because his couetous mind still maketh him beleeue that he hath neuer enough for his owne store. And by reason of this vnsatiable greedinesse, these rich misers are euer readie, like spunges, to suck vp any gaine and profit, but when they haue it, will part with none, vnlesse they be pressed, and as it were crushed with violence or importunitie. Though <hi>Nabal</hi> was<note place="margin">1.

Though the rich man in the Gospell tooke care<note place="margin">Luke 12.</note> enough, and more then he needed, to fill his barnes, yet so carelesse was he in doing good, that when his barnes were ouer full, he rather resolued to inlarge them to his great cost<note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> and trouble, then he would part with any of his store in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, because riches do naturally inflame the hearts of couetous men towards them; and loue making them loath to part with the thing loued, causes them rather to reserue their wealth with the hazard of their soules, then they will ascertaine themselues of the least losse, by feeding the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, and supplying the necessities of those that want. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof these couetous wretches may be fitly likened to the minerall mountaines, which are full of gold and siluer, but barren and vnfruitfull; for so barren he is in good works,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:10731:283"/> that (as one saith) he neuer doth well but when he dieth, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then he hath an end of his vnsatiable couetousnesse, and setteth at libertie those riches for the good of others, which were long enthralled in a wretched bondage: for whilest he liueth he will part with nothing which he possesseth, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the poore shall share with him in any part of his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie, he will spend it on his backe in excessiue brauerie, on his horse in rich furniture, yea vpon his senselesse walles, and the very floore whereon he treadeth.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, these worldly things do not make those<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. That worldly things do not make them who haue them more merrie and cheerefull.</hi>
                  </note> merrie and cheerefull, who most abound with them, if their hearts and affections be seated on them; he that doteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on honors, doth not so much ioy in twentie gotten prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as he doth fret at one missed, nor reioyceth in that he is aduanced before many, but is vexed because he seeth any preferred before him; neither is he so much cheared in his mind, because he hath the reuerence and obeysance of cap and knee, from almost all men, as he is tormented if any one man wilfully denieth him that dutie and obseruance which he expecteth, his proud heart making him beleeue that his worth well deserueth it. So when <hi>Haman</hi> being surfetted with ioy, in regard of the Kings especiall fauour, came forth and saw <hi>Mordecai</hi> neglect him, in the middest of his iollitie<note place="margin">Hester 5. 9. 10. 11. 13.</note> and gladnes, he was filled with indignation, and like a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne man, full of discontent, he retireth himselfe home, and telleth his wife and friends of all his riches, glorie, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fauours, which he had receiued both from the King and Queene; but concludeth that all the honor which he had from all besides <hi>Mordecai</hi> did him no good, because he alone did not respect and reuerence him. So what pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light hath he, who abounding in riches, doth set his hart vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, more then the poore man, who hath but a small competencie, and only necessaries to releeue him? Yea doth not this man sleepe more soundly, feed more sauourly and with greater delight; looke more cheerefully, and reioyce more heartily then he who is ouer-burthened with his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance?

Contrariwise, he spendeth his daies in murmuring and repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, alwaies caring and fearing, and neuer being at rest: if there be faire weather, he straight complaineth of drought; if a little foule come, he saith all will be drowned and rotted; hee is alike discontented with great plenty, and with great dearth; the one because he enuieth his neighbour, the other because he feareth to want himselfe. And faine would hee, if he could tell how, haue plentie in his owne fields, and scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in other mens; superfluitie at home, and dearth abrode, that he might sell his corne at the dearer rate. In respect of<note place="margin">Aristonymus apud Stobaeum Serm. 8.</note> all which cares, feares, and griefes: the couetous mans life though he be neuer so rich, is compared to a funerall feast, which hath abundance of all things sauing mirth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. An example whereof we haue in <hi>Ahab,</hi> who though he possessed a kingdome, yet because he desired, and could not haue <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard, was so farre from reioycing in all that he had, that he was euen sicke with griefe, casting himselfe on his bed, and refusing his food, as though hee had lost all,<note place="margin">1.

                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:10731:284"/> whereas he onely wanted that which hee neuer had. So that it is not a kingdome of wealth that will purchase to a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man a dram of pleasure, it being so ordered by Gods wise and gratious prouidence, that pleasures should not bee purchased with gold and siluer (for then rich men would haue ingrossed them into their owne hands to sell them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine at dearer rates) but rather he would haue them bought with the coine of labour and necessitie, that the poore might haue a larger share in them then they who abound in wealth, and contrariwise hath ioyned griefe, care and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Againe, this state of prosperity assureth vs not of the fauour of men; yea rather it maketh vs vtterly vncertain who are our friends, and who are not: For they who flourish in the world haue many friends in shew, and few in truth, seeing they are friends to their prosperity, and not to themselues, they honour their places and not their persons; it is the idoll of wealth which the route adoreth, and not the asse that beareth it; it is the honie of profit which these hungrie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

It is not the man but mirth which is affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; and so long as they banquet, feast, and sport together, they make great loue and friendship one to another; but let the bond of pleasure bee once broken, by want, or sicknesse, and these friends are straightway scattered. And yet are men so blinded with selfe-loue, that being in prosperity, they thinke they haue so many friends as they haue flatterers; and howsoeuer their owne hearts tell them, that they themselues fawne vpon many whom they doe not affect, and bow vnto a number whom they doe not inwardly honour, and keepe company with diuers, not for any great loue to their persons, but because they are fit instruments of their pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; yet such an opinion they haue of their owne worth, that they doe not once imagine that others pay them with their owne coine, but verily thinke that they are in good sadnesse, though themselues iest, and that all the honour and respect, loue and friendship which other men shew vnto them, is simple and from the heart, though they know that themselues make as faire a shew, and yet doe but counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait and dissemble.</p>

Neither are riches more profitable for these purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; for though a man haue goodly houses, rich furniture, great reuenewes, and abundance of gold and siluer; yet all will not preuent the least sicknesse before it commeth, nor free him of it when it hath seazed on him: yea rather they are causes of weakening the strength and impairing the health: for who seeth not by continuall experience that the poore do much excell the rich; countrimen, citizens; and seruants their masters in health and strength, being much more able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure hunger and thirst, heate and cold, watching and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full labour; and to continue in these laborious imployments without any great wearinesse, and with much chearefulnes, which in an instant would quite tire the other? And this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, first, because riches do make men wanton and effeminate, whilest they ouer-tenderly looke to their bodie, not suffering it to indure any hardnes, but inuring it to warmth, daintines, and ease, which in a while custome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth so necessarie, that they cannot want any thing which they haue before vsed without impairing of their health.

Lastly, they prepare the seeds for all sicknesses and diseases through their idlenesse; for making it not only a matter of ease, but of honor and state, to abstaine from all labour themselues, and to do all their businesse by their seruants and deputies, they lose that needfull exercise which preserueth health, and for want of stirring, suffer hurtfull humors to increase and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in them: neither haue they that stomacke and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to their meat, which they that labour haue, but come to their full tables, with fuller bellies and cloyed appetites, and so either eate nothing, or that which is worse, against their stomacks. And whereas they who take paines need no other sauce but salt and hunger to sharpen their appetite, because exercise helpeth their digestion, and renueth their hunger, which giueth a good rellish to their coursest fare, and maketh it wholesome nourishment for their bodies: contrariwise, they who spend their time in sloth and idlenes, wanting this helpe for their concoction, come to the table, hauing their stomackes full of the last meales crudities, which maketh them to loath their greatest dainties, and so either to fast, or to replenish and cram their bellies with renued gluttonie.

The greater honours that men haue, the greater shall be their ignominie and confusion of face at this day, if they haue not vsed them for the aduancing of Gods glory, and for the countenancing and maintaining of vertue and religion, as also for the discountenancing and suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of sinne and wickednesse. The greater wealth they haue, the greater shall be their plagues, if when God commeth to visit, it shall be found that they haue not by these rich talents honoured their Lord and master, and comforted and relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their fellow seruants, but haue consumed them on their owne lusts in riot and excesse. The more they haue aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in voluptuous pleasures, the more shall they abound in paines; if in their mirth they haue kept no meane, and haue not onely recreated and refreshed themselues, but euen sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetted in these carnall delights, feeding (like the rich glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton) deliciously, and going richly apparelled euery day; and<note place="margin">Amos. 6. 4. 5. 6.</note> as the Prophet speaketh, drinking wine in bowles, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselues with their sweete musicke, and stretching themselues on their iuory beds, but in the meane time ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer remembring the affiictions of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> nor relieuing poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> with the crums of his table.</p>

Or what now helpeth it vs to haue often heard melodious musicke, to haue seene many delightfull shewes, and to haue spent much of our time in vaine sports and pastimes, when as being all passed away like a dreame in the night, nothing tarieth with vs but paine, feare and anguish of mind? In a word, after we haue long tired our selues in hunting after these worldly vanities, we shall then conclude that we haue spent our strength in vaine, and in our hands haue found nothing: for then all these things being taken from vs, we shall go out of the world as naked and bare as we came into it, hauing nothing of all which we possessed, but a poore sheete to couer vs: and as the milstone which turneth about all day, grinding corne for others, and not for it selfe, doth at night stand in the same place where it was in the morning, and after that great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of graine hath passed by it, is emptied of all, hauing no

Thus the rich man grieueth to part with his riches, as much as to part with his life, and is tormented as much that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must haue them, as that he must leaue them: and thus the voluptuous man sorroweth, because he must now leaue all his pleasant company, good fare, and delightfull sports and pastimes, which all his life he hath loued much better then his owne soule. Now the reason of this their double death, and extreame sorrow: is first, because they part with these things which their soule loueth, hauing no hope of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining better things after this life. For whereas (as the Wise man speaketh) <hi>the righteous hath his chiefe hope euen in his</hi>

<pb n="510" facs="tcp:10731:291"/> the true God; and leaue with griefe worldly vanities, when they haue no assurance of heauenly ioyes. Secondly, this parting with the world and worldly things, shall be at that day most bitter and grieuous, because when they forsake them, they shall leaue that sinne behind them, which hath bin occasioned by them, either in their getting, keeping, or disposing them. For being stripped of al these things, nothing shall be left vnto them but the gaules of an euill conscience, which in sense of smart shall then crie out vpon them, because they haue aspired vnto honors by Machiauellian policies, or haue not vsed their credit and authoritie, for the aduancing of vertue and suppressing of sin; and haue made themselues rich with deceit and oppression, or haue not communicated their wealth to the reliefe of the poore, and the furthering of pious and charitable actions; and haue wallowed in carnall pleasures, vtterly neglecting the meanes of attaining vnto the ioyes of heauen. And thus sinne shall accompany them when al things else shal leaue them. And as <hi>Zophar</hi> speaketh, <hi>The wicked mans bones are full of the sinnes of his youth, and they</hi>

O how<note place="margin">Matth. 16. 26.</note> true then will he find the saying of our Sauiour, What will it profit a man to gaine the whole world, and to lose his owne soule? How much would he giue at this day for a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and to haue peace made betweene God and his owne soule? How will he condemne his owne folly for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming his life and strength in seeking these worldly vanities which now must leaue him, neglecting those heauenly ioyes which being once obtained, would neuer haue forsaken
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:10731:291"/> him? How much now doth he preferre a dram of grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an earthly kingdome, and a few good workes, before a world of riches? Finally, willingly now would he, if he might, exchange all his glory, wealth and carnall delights, with the skorne, pouerty, and afflictions of the most contemned chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, so that also he might share with him in his hopes, and partake with him in those heauenly ioyes.</p>
               <p>But though these earthly vanities could profit vs at our last departure, by sweetening death, and making his sting<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 12 That worldly things profit not after our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</hi>
                  </note> lesse grieuous, yet what good will they doe vs after our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration? Seeing now there is no difference betweene the rich and the poore, the king and the begger; betweene him who languished in miserie and trouble, and another which hath spent his life in pleasures and pastimes? For as nature putteth no difference between the one and the other in their birth; so neither doth it distinguish betweene them after<note place="margin">Ambros. lib. de Nabuth. cap. 1. tom. 4.</note> their death: all haue the like ingresse and egresse, when they enter into, and leaue the world; alike in the wombe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in the graue. For open the earth, and see if thou canst dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the rich from the poore, or the noble from the base; sauing that only there is this difference, that more perisheth with the one then with the other; the rich hauing a fairer tombe and finer sheet, or more sweet odours wherewith hee is embalmed; all which are losses to the liuing, and not helps to the dead, seeing these good things are bereaued of their grace and sweetnesse, but doe not inrich the dead corps with their vertue and excellencie. Yea if in this life wee haue set our hearts vpon these vanities, esteeming and louing them better then God himselfe, his spirituall graces and heauenly ioyes; if vnrepented sinne haue accompanied them, either in their getting or fruition, then how vnprofitable shall wee find them after death, yea how hurtfull and pernicious to our wretched soules? For what will it auaile vs to bee extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led where we are not, and to be condemned where we are? to haue with <hi>Diues</hi> rich friends on earth, which haue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of whole riuers, and to be our selues in hell fire, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to obtaine a small drop of water with earnest intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? to haue left many delights behind vs, and to haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:10731:292"/> but torments with vs? O how many worlds would a man in this case giue for the redemption of his soule out of these hellish tortures, which hee hath plunged himselfe into for the obtaining, for a smal moment of time (as it were) a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle handful of these earthly vanities? how much doth he now loath those things which before hee so much loued, seeing by wofull experience hee findeth that they haue depriued him of those true and eternall ioyes, and haue been the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of his fearefull condemnation?</p>
               <p>Finally, though worldly vanities should accompany vs to<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 13. That worldly things will not profit vs at the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </note> the graue, yet what will they profit vs at the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? for then we shall be examined, not how we haue flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in the world, but how faithfully we haue serued God; neither will the Lord our Iudge then consider how honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable we haue been amongst men, but how much wee haue honoured him, who hath caused vs to bee thus honoured; nor what great offices we haue borne, but how we haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged them; nor respect vs according to our earthly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, but according to the measure of that glory which by them we haue deriued to him, and of that good which we haue done to his church and the poore members of Iesus Christ, with that credit and authoritie wherewith God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed vs. Then the Lord will not regard how many praises we haue had amongst men, but how praise-worthie we haue been in his sight; not how they haue magnified vs, but how we haue magnified his glorious name; nor how many caps and knees we haue had from our inferiours, but how oft and zealously we haue humbled our soules, and bowed the knees of our hearts in praying vnto him for his mercies wanting, and in praising him for his benefits receiued. Then will not our Iudge respect vs for our riches which wee had in the world, (for he will not receiue bribes, neither shall wee then haue any thing to giue) but those at this day shall haue his fauour, who haue abounded in the spirituall riches of his sanctifying graces; hee will not regard how rich wee haue been in lands, but in holinesse of life, not in our chests, but in our consciences; he will not esteeme vs for our wealth, but for our good workes; nor yet because wee in this life had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:10731:292"/> but because wee did liberally bestow it in the workes of charity and mercy, and spared for no cost to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all pious and religious actions; vsing like faithfull ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards these rich talents to the glory of our master, and the good of our fellow seruants. Neither shall those who heere hunted after worldly gaine be respected because they seazed on their prey, but he that <hi>hath followed after righteousnes and</hi>

                  <hi>mercy, shall find life, righteousnesse and glory;</hi> as the Wise man speaketh. Finally, the pleasures of this life wil then little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit vs, neither will it auaile vs that wee haue had much ioy in the world, but ioy in the holy Ghost; not that wee haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded in worldly delights, but that our soules haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted themselues in the Lord, and reioyced in him, not onely in prosperity, but also in affliction and tribulation. Yea contrariwise wee shall find at this day that these worldly things shall but increase our bils of account, seeing wee shall be called to a reckoning how we haue gotten, kept and disposed them; which accounts if we cannot make euen, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by shewing how wee haue imployed the talents recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or by laying before the eyes of our Iudge our acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and generall pardon bought with Christs precious blood, and sealed vnto vs by his holy spirit, wee shall be cast into the prison of vtter darkenesse, there to remaine vntill<note place="margin">Quae hic hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, ibi on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And for all our passed plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures<note place="margin">Eccles. 11. 9.</note> we shall, as the Wise man telleth vs, bee brought vnto iudgement.

O then what will it auaile vs to haue been praised of men, God and our owne consciences not approuing vs, seeing we shal not now be defended of men when God shall iudge, nor deliuered by them, when as he shall condemne vs? What will it profit vs to haue been rich in the world, when as being stripped of all, wee shall haue nothing left, but our sinnes and sores which they haue made in our consciences in getting or vsing them? Finally, what good shall our passed pleasures then bring vnto vs, when as hauing abandoned and left vs, nothing remaineth of them but pollution and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of soule, and the iust wrath of God, whom we haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased by pleasing our selues with these wicked delights? or in a word, what will it profit vs to haue gained the whole<note place="margin">Mark. 8. 36.</note> world, and to haue lost our owne soules?</p>

                  </note> of these worldly things, which were sufficient to weane our hearts from them, though there were no other reasons: for who would affect these worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse vanities, which neither satisfie, nor profit those that haue them? But though it should be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they were not thus vaine, but in their owne nature of some worth; say that in themselues they were profitable, and therefore to be desired; yet let vs further know, that they are so mingled with miseries, and so distasted with the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse of adherent euils, as that there is no reason why we
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:10731:294"/> should much esteeme them, or set our hearts vpon them: for let vs put into the one scole, those things that we thinke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the name of good, which is to be desired; and into the other, the miseries, euils, inconueniences, and discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which alwaies do accompanie them; and we shal find that there is no proportion, betweene the huge heape of the one, and the little graine of the other, betweene the ocean of miserie, and small drop of true delight and happinesse. It is true that this notable hypocrite the world is alwaies readie to deceiue vs, by promising vnto vs excellent benefits, and things sincerely good, without the mixture of any euill; but when it commeth to performance, behold it tempereth a dram of honie with a pound of gall; it promiseth all good, but it payeth vs with euill, or at least mixeth it with so little good, that it serueth but to giue vs a more quicke taste and true rellish of these euils which accompany it: it promiseth life and payeth death; it proffereth ioy, but behold it giueth sorrow; and commonly if we haue but one good meale of delight and comfort, we must walke in the strength thereof many daies, and hauing nothing to seed vpon but trouble and discontent, lose all that former pleasure many times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, with griefes and crosses, before our comforts be againe renued. And thus doth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> world, like a stately built sepulchre, make vnto vs outwardly a goodly shew, though there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within but rottennes and putrefaction; and like a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile merchant, it offereth vs a good sample of bad wares, and outwardly presenteth to our view the best end of the stuffe, whereas the inmost and middle parts are course and slight; and placeth the purest and choicest commodities in the vpper part of the vessell, whereas in the middle and the bottome, it is mixt, counterfeit, and purposely falsified to deceiue vs. Neither in truth is it more apt to deceiue, then we to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued; for as those who are borne in a mill are so well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with noise, that it little disquieteth them; and as they who are bred and brought vp in a prison, are not much troubled with their restraint, nor offended with their little light, not grieued to carrie their giues and bolts; yea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, when their irons are but a little lightned, they are
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:10731:294"/> comforted and refreshed, as though they were set at libertie, and think a little bettering of their scant &amp; hungrie meales, a great feast and daintie banquet: whereas those who haue bin brought vp in great plentie and full libertie, sorow at the others ioyes, and are tormented with griefe, in the middest of their wretched comforts. So because we are from the first moment of our birth brought vp and inured to this noise of miseries; because we had our first being, and breeding in this wretched prison of the world, we are readie to loue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in our little inlarged imprisonment, as though wee had attained vnto perfect libertie, and to account our least miseries our greatest happinesse: whereas if either with our first parents we had euer tasted of the ioies of Paradise, or had but only in vision with the blessed Apostle, the least glimpse of our heauenly glorie, the worlds greatest libertie would appeare to be a thraldome, and his most delicious sweets would be as bitter as gall, and as loathsome to our taste as the infusion of worme wood, yea in truth as the chymicall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of <hi>Colyquintida.</hi>

               <p>But this miserie of mans life will better appeare, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 3. The miseries of mans life in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of sinne.</hi>
                  </note> it in the parts thereof, which are chiefly two, sin and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; for the former, we are euen in our first conception,
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:10731:295"/> so wholly defiled with that corruption of nature which hath been deriued vnto vs from our first parents, that we are onely aliue to sinne, but dead to grace and all goodnesse; vnable so much as to moue in the way of righteousnesse which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto life, although we runne with headlong hast in the way of wickednesse, which bringeth those who goe in it, to perdition and eternall death. And from this fountaine of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall sinne, issue the poysonous streames of actuall trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, whereby wee breake continually, through the whole course of our life, all the commandements of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, omitting the duties which hee hath commanded, and committing the sinnes which hee hath forbidden. In which misery of sin we are wholly plūged before we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and conuerted vnto God, committing all maner of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes with ful swinge &amp; cōsent of wil, delighting our selues and reioycing in our rebellion; by reason whereof wee are naturally strangers and enemies vnto God, subiect to his wrath, to the curse of the law, and to al those feareful plagues and punishments, which therin are denounced against trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressours, the slaues of sinne and Satan, and heires of eternall death. Yea and after wee are conuerted vnto God, the flesh continually lusteth against the spirit, and the corruptions of<note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> nature remaine so strong in vs, that we cannot doe the good we would, but the euill which we would not doe, that doe we. And as we are by this law of our members rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the law of our mind, daily led captiue vnto sinne; so are we thereby in such sort disabled, that wee cannot, to the day of our death, offer vnto God any one pure and perfect dutie, without the filthy spots and staines of our corruption. Now what a miserie is this, that we who were created Gods glorious creatures, according to his owne image, to the end that we should serue him in holines of life, should, as though wee had forgotten the end wherefore wee came into the world, neglect all dutie to our Creator, and become volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie slaues to sinne and Satan, ready to doe his will; though we haue nothing for our wages but eternall death? yea euen after wee are called and reconciled vnto God, how great is our miserie whilest wee continue in this life, seeing wee are
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:10731:296"/> daily intangled in the snares of sin, and haue our best actions so imperfect and stained with our corruptions, that if the Lord should examine them according to his righteous iudgement, they would deserue a curse rather then a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and punishment rather then a reward? What a miserie is this, that after we haue with <hi>Iacob</hi> preuailed with God, we should halt of our corruptions to the day of death; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we haue broken out of the prison of Satans bondage, and shaken off the chaines of his subiections, al our ioynts should be so stiffe and benummed, that wee should to the very end of life, lamely performe all holy duties, and halt like wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched creeples in the waies of God? Finally, that the more time is added to our daies, the more wee should adde to the heape of our sinnes, and prouoke our good God to iust dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, who hath so tenderly loued vs, that hee gaue his owne deare sonne to death for the perfecting of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption?</p>
               <p>And this is the chiefe part of all our miserie, as being that<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. That the things of this life are commended onely by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie.</hi>
                  </note> cursed fountaine from which all the rest spring and flow; for by reason hereof all the creatures in the world are made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to corruption, and being made for blessings, they are turned into punishments; and though outwardly they seeme excellent and desireable, yet this hidden poyson of sinne se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly lurking in them, maketh vs to cast them vp with griefe, when with great pleasure we haue swallowed them downe. So that euen those things which we chiefly affect are full of wretchednesse, besides those innumerable miseries ioyned with them, which all taking notice of, doe abhorre and shun. And though the things we desire were freed from outward and accidentall euils; yet themselues bring with them mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie enough to make them iustly loathsome to all that iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously taste and rellish them. For the chiefe goodnesse of these worldly things which we desire, consisteth not in any abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute excellency that is in themselues, but onely as they are present helpes to free vs for the time from the euils which we feare; and no other worth or esteeme haue they but as they come commended by some vrgent necessity: thus wee desire riches, not so much for any excellencie we see in them,
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:10731:296"/> as because we feare and shunne pouerty; thus honours are esteemed, because we feare disgrace; thus meate hath onely so much goodnesse in it, as men haue hunger that feed vpon it, and drinke hath it worth from thirst; thus summer is commended vnto vs, by winter, warmeth by our cold, and the coole aire, by intemperate heate. In a word, nothing in the world is esteemed good, but onely so far forth as it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth letters of commendations from necessity, and serueth as a present meanes to free vs from some euill, and to make vs lesse miserable. And if wanting the praise which need impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto it, it offer it selfe vnto vs, it is vnwelcome, and we forthwith loath and dislike it. If meate come before hunger haue made way for it in our desires, who is not glutted with the sight of it? If drinke be not commended by thirst, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth it? If we haue more clothes laid on vs when wee are hot enough, we esteeme it a burthen and not a benefit: If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of wealth were offered vnto vs, not hauing before any want of it, and consequently no desire, wee would not much value it: Finally, so much worth and esteeme these worldly things haue, as we haue first want and miserie. So that in truth he who hath most need, and is most wretched, he hath most ioy and comfort by these earthly vanities when he hath liberty to inioy them; he who is most hungrie, hath also most pleasure by meate; hee that is thirstiest, hath most delight in drinke; and we must first want in state, or at least in mind, before riches haue any great welcome: yea plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure it selfe hath no sweet rellish till our appetite bee sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the sharpe sauce of miserie and affliction, neither would any man thinke himselfe more happie for the acccesse of worldly things, vnlesse it were for former felt, or future feared vnhappinesse.</p>

For in truth the diseases are natural, here ditarie, rooted in our first principles, &amp; hauing settled themselues in our bones and
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:10731:297"/> marrow they are incurable. And therefore as that is estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the best medicine for the gout which remoueth the fit, and that the best salue which keepeth the incurable vlcer cleane and sweet: so those are esteemed best among worldly things, that for the present serue as medicines to ease our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall miseries, which it is altogether impossible fully to heale and cure. This will better appeare if wee consider of some speciall instances; for what is hunger but a disease, which will consume a man in a few daies, like that called the wolfe, which if it bee not fed with outward things, feedeth vpon the body till it haue destroyed it? And what is meate but the medicine of this sicknesse, which because it cannot perfectly cure it, therefore it is continually applied to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue the fit, and to asswage the present paine? What is thirst but a sicknesse, which would soone dispatch vs, vnles drinke as a physicall potion did for the instant serue for a remedie? So what is watching but a naturall disease? and what is sleep but the medicine, that for the time helpeth it? What is couetousnesse but the soules feauer? and what riches, but as a medicine which sometime easeth the fit for the present, though afterwards it bee more raging? what ambition, but the hearts tympanie? and what honours, but an instant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing, which for a while allaieth the griefe, though it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaseth then abateth the swelling? What is voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, but as the Wise man calleth it, a merrie madnesse, which hath some present comfort, by pleasures and delights? What is labour, but a sicknesse, which rest easeth? what standing, but an infirmitie, which sitting mitigateth? and this also long vsed becommeth of a medicine a disease, which another kind of disposition or placing of the body doth for the time refresh? All which though custome make them so familiar, that we doe not take any serious regard of them, yet if we could possiblie bee freed from them but one yeere, and liue without hunger, thirst, cold, heate, labour, concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, we would account them as troublesome diseases, if againe they should sease vpon vs.</p>

Now if we further consider, that as our miseries do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly in number exceed our comforts; so also one of them is sufficient to infuse such bitternesse into a multitude of our most desired delights, that we cannot rellish their sweetnes, that one ounce of this gall of miserie, maketh loathsome a whole pound of our sugred ioyes, and that a small dram of
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:10731:298"/> this <hi>Colyquintida,</hi> is enough to distaste a whole pot of pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, making it to sauour of death; then how little sweetnes of comfort must we needs haue, when as the part which we loath and abhorre, so innumerable degrees exceedeth that which we like and loue? But who seeth not that one tooth aking doth more vex vs, then the health of all the rest of the bodie can delight vs? that we are more tormented with a small losse, then comforted with great possessions? that when but one friend of many is taken away, we haue more true griefe by him which is lost, then ioy and contentment in all the rest? that we are more disquieted with one disgrace, then delighted with many honors? and that we are not so much pleased in the fruition of many things loued and desired, as we are displeased when we are cut short of our hopes, or are troubled and combred with some euill which we loath and hate? and the reason is, because miseries doe make a much deeper impression in vs then our comforts, partly because they being in this vale of teares, as it were in their own place and element, haue more vigour and strength in them, one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing the force of another, as diuers sticks in the same fire; and retaine their owne nature without alteration; whereas good things are more weake and feeble in this place of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, as being not proper to them, and lose much of their puritie and vertue, through the mixture and tainture of adhering euils: and partly, because by reason of our vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, we are alwaies readie to extenuate Gods blessings, and neuer almost thinke of them, but when they are taken from vs; and contrariwise, if we haue the least sparke of euil, we are apt and willing to blow vpon it with the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But let vs descend to some particulars, and for orders sake<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 8. Of the miseries incident to a mans state.</hi>
                  </note> distinguish the miseries of mans life into some kinds; not that it is my purpose to speake largely of all, seeing they are so many and innumerable, that it would require a mans whole life to make but a bare catalogue or relation of them: but only so many of them briefly, as may serue to weane our hearts from the world which aboundeth with such miseries;
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:10731:299"/> and to fixe them on God his spirituall graces and heauenly happines, which bring vs sincere ioy, without the mixture of any euils. The miseries then of mans life either respect him generally, or his seuerall ages and estates. The generall mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries vnto which mans life is subiect, are either those which are his own directly, or else his friends, which are his by sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie, compassion and fellow feeling. Concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, if we do but take a slight view of those miseries to which our fraile life is subiect, we shall find that euen a large world of wretchednesse, doth ouerwhelme this little world of man, and that whether we respect his state or person. For first, vnto how many miseries is man subiect about his state, whilest he seeketh to preserue and maintaine, or to aduance and better it? with what painfull labours doth he spend his strength in the workes of his calling, that he may prouide sufficient for himselfe and his charge, which dependeth vpon him? what cares, what watching, running, riding, buying, selling, plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, sowing, reaping, and turmoiling to get a poore liuing?

                  <hi>not from the dust, neither doth affliction spring out of the earth; but man is borne vnto trauaile, as the sparkes flie vpward.</hi> With all which labours when as he hath worne out both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and mind, oftentimes for want of Gods blessing he hath no successe, and hath iust cause to complaine, that he hath spent his strength in vaine, seeing with all his industrie and labour he cannot attaine vnto the things which he laboureth for; but notwithstanding all his diligence pineth with want, or hauing found that he sought for, how is he troubled in the possession, how grieued with his losses, whilest God blowing vpon that he hath, notwithstanding all his care and labour, it vanisheth like smoake, leauing him in pouertie, who ere whiles was rich, and in contempt and disgrace, who not long since was respected and esteemed of all? Againe, how innumerable are our wants aboue all other creatures in the world, &amp; what care and paines is required to make a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, and to furnish vs with necessaries and sufficiencie? what adoe to prouide vs nourishment, what catering and cooking, boiling, roasting, baking, saucing? and when it is set before
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:10731:299"/> vs how ignorant are we of the measure of our owne bellies, how hardly doe we keepe a meane in our diet, feeding suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently without surfetting? What care and cost is required to furnish vs with apparell, housing, lodging, bedding, and other furniture? What dieting and watching ouer our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite that it doe not make vs ouer greedily to feed vpon that which we too sondly affect, and so impaire our health? and being lost, what physicke, medicines, bitter pilles, and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some potions, cautherizing, cutting, lanching, and plaiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring are we faine to vse that wee may recouer it? Whereas the brutish creatures either want not these things, or easilie supplie their need without care or labour. What lands and possessions are needfull for mans vse? what purchases, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, conueiances, suits in law, troubles and contentions, to hold that he hath, and secure his right? It were infinite to particularise those things which man wanteth, all which are so necessarie vnto him, either in truth, or in his owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that his life without them cannot bee comfortable; and looke how much of them is lacking, and so much is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from his happinesse, and added to his miserie.</p>
               <p>Let vs adde to the miseries of state, the miseries of person,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 9. Of the miseries incident to a mans person, and first in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his body.</hi>
                  </note> and that both body &amp; soule. The body of man is continually subiect to many miseries; as hunger, thirst, heat, cold, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wearines; and that which is more cumbersome and grieuous then al the rest, vnto innumerable sorts of sicknesses and diseases: for how many maladies are peculiarly incident to euery time of the yeere; as spring, summer, autumne, and winter, to euery countrie and region, sex and age? how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diseases which ouerthrow the health of the whole body, as plague, feuers, agues, consumptions, palsies and the rest; yea how many are incident to euery seuerall part, and as it were in whole troopes attend vpon euery particular member of mans body? surely so innumerable are they, that physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to this day cannot discouer, much lesse cure them; and howsoeuer they haue filled many large volumes with them, yet they come farre short of their infinite number, though those which they haue already found, would make a man sicke but barely to reckon them: many of which though
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:10731:300"/> some escape, yet few or none are exempted from them all; it being a thing impossible, though we were all an eye, to keep such narrow watch ouer our health as may bee sufficient to preserue it from the violence of so many enemies which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault vs on all sides, within vs, without vs, and round about vs. Vnto which we may adde the tedious trouble and loathsome remedies which we are faine to vse when our health is impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when as we are bound to forbeare the things which wee chiefly desire, and to vse those which our nature abhorreth, pining our bodies with abstinence, which were oppressed with fulnesse, and swallowing into our stomackes loathsome medicines, which wee haue first distempered with licorous meates. Whereby it is hard to chuse whether the physicke or disease, the medicine or the maladie be the worse: seeing our cure it selfe is a sicknesse, our helpes hurts, and our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines torments; neither can we be deliuered from our griefs, but by suffering more griefe, nor free our selues from these kinds of punishments, vnlesse we be content to bee further punished.</p>
               <p>And these are some of those manifold miseries which are<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 10. Of the manifold miseries of man in respect of his soule.</hi>
                  </note> incident to the body; the which are not more in number, or so grieuous and pernicious in their nature and quality, as those which trouble and torment the mind. For sinne is the sicknesse of the soule, and therefore looke with how many corruptions it is infected, and with so many spirituall disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses<note place="margin">Iob 8. 9.</note> it is endangered. The vnderstanding is subiect to the blindnesse of ignorance; so as we may say with the Prophet,<note place="margin">Ier. 10. 14.</note> that we are beasts by our owne knowledge; seeing we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know God, nor his will, our selues, nor our owne soules. Our willes are crooked and rebellious, and so whirled about with a wilfull frensie, as neither reason nor religion can rule or gouerne them. Our memories are subiect to a spirituall le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie, forgetting still what we should remember, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring what we should forget. Our consciences are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sicke of the dead palsie, hauing no sense or feeling of Gods mercies or iudgements; or else full of melancholicke feares and terrours, sores and wounds, so as they are ready desperately to crie out, when they haue the least touch. Our
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:10731:300"/> hearts are the harborow of almost all diseases, there lodgeth the swelling tumor of pride, the wolfe of ambition, the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of couetousnesse, the madnesse of anger, and burning fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of furious reuenge. In it dwelleth our tumultuous passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which continually rebell against reason, and denie sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to God and his law; there is the seate of carnall loue, which setteth the heart on fire with the thing loued, and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it with continuall torment when it cannot enioy it; there dwelleth enuie and hatred, the one tormenting a man with anothers happinesse, the other turmoiling him in plotting and contriuing his neighbours ruine, making himselfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently miserable, because hee would haue another so in time to come. In it is mirth and mourning, ioy and sorrow, the one pulling open the heart, and letting in much vanitie; the other contracting and shutting it, that it may keepe out all comfort and contentment, and both like rackets tossing a man interchangeablie the one to the other, till hee bee tired, and euen worne out with wearinesse. There harboreth hope, the great deceiuer of mankind, which maketh him continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to expect better, though he still findeth worse; and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him daily to beleeue it, and to refresh his soule with false comforts, after it hath ten thousand times failed him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerably often defrauded his hungrie desires. And there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so dwelleth feare, which maketh a man presently miserable because he seeth a possibility of future miserie, and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him not onely by aggrauating those euils which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but also by recalling those which are past, and by anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating, and present apprehending those which are to come, many whereof are nothing so grieuous felt as feared, and many neuer happening at all: and yet these false feares beget true sorrowes, and cause no lesse griefe though they neuer happen, then if they were already happened, killing a man with an emptie sound, and as it were with paper-shot, and making him miserable in truth, because hee is so in his owne conceite. Wherein we are much more wretched then the brutish creatures; for they forget euils past, and flie from those which are present, and hauing escaped are secure for the time to come, quietly enioying their present delights
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:10731:301"/> without any perturbation of future dangers; whereas feare maketh vs to engrosse all griefes, and as though we could not be miserable enough with present euils, it recalleth those which are past, and layeth hold on those to come: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it were our wisest course to flie our sorrowes til they catch vs, and to delay our miserie, which we cannot wholly escape, that we may prolong our comfort as long as may bee; feare maketh vs foolishly to runne vpon our owne ruine, and to meet our torments in the mid way, not staying for sorrowes vntill they come, but wilfully sending for them with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting speed, and haling them into our hearts before their time.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, besides these miseries which accompanie eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 11. Of the miseries of man, through the contrarie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  </note> single passion, those are no lesse grieuous and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, which befall vs through their opposition and fight, not onely against reason, conscience and religion; in which conflict we are wounded notwithstanding our strongest and best approued armour, sometime with vaine glory, somtime with auarice, sometime with voluptuousnesse, often with anger, &amp; desire of reuenge, and not seldome with many other vnrulie &amp; violent affections; but euen we are no lesse turmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with that ciuill dissension, &amp; intestine conflict which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our passions &amp; desires, the one against the other, which are so opposite &amp; contrary among themselues, that no wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of man can reconcile them. Whilest ambition haleth vs into the seate of honour, feare pulleth vs backe, putting vs in mind of the burthen, and danger which doth accompanie it, and whilest the former hath the vpper hand we condemne our cowardize, whilest the other wee exclaime against the mischiefes of ambition. So vaineglory persuadeth vs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure at the dearest rates the praise of bountie, and to purchase the loue of all that are about vs; but couetousnesse checketh this motion, and will not heare of parting with riches to buy smoke, and yet after auarice hath shut the purse, pride, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will or no, doth againe pull it open. So voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes inticeth vs to follow pleasures, but desire of profit oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth against it, telling vs how foolish it is to spend vpon the stocke, and how vnseasonable those pleasures are for time of
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:10731:301"/> strength, which is allotted to industrie and labour; and yet when we haue put our hand vpon the plow, pleasure clapping vs on the backe, maketh vs looke behind vs, and leauing our profit to follow our delights. Thus we desire the ease of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie life, but loath, neglect and contempt, and are in loue with the respect that accompanieth action, but hate the care and labour. Thus we desire the multiplication of our yeeres, but feare old age and death, as though we would be alwaies trauelling, and neuer be the forwarder in our way, and haue a daily addition, without any increase; for what is old age but the multiplication of many yeeres? and what is death but the hauen vnto which we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Thus we loue learning and wisdome, but loath the paines of studie and obseruation; we desire to be rid of the tedious troubles of life, but present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnsay that wee haue said, being incountred with the feare of death. And finally, we are rauished with ioy when we thinke of the fruition of God, and the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but when we heare that we must sell that we haue, and giue to the poore, forsake all, take vp our crosse and follow Christ, we go away sorrowfull; we would be conformable vnto Christ in glorie, but not in his sufferings, and sit vpon his throne on his right hand and on his left, but we cannot indure to drinke with him in the cup of affliction: and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, we do not sooner with one affection desire any thing, then we are straight ready to vnwish our wishes, by reason of some inconueniences which crosse another.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I shewed the manifold miseries which are<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 12 Of the miseries of mans life in respect of his friends.</hi>

But besides these miseries which respect a mans selfe, there are innumerable more which respect his friends; and to say nothing of false and pretended loue, whereby men proue most pernicious enemies, whilest they professe the greatest friendship; to say nothing of the breaches, fallings out, and hot contentions which sometime happen betweene those who are coupled in the neerest bond of amitie; and to passe by all those discontents which are caused through the default of any partie: how many are the miseries which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie true friendship, euen when it is most wisely inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and religiously obserued? For who can see his friend thunder-strucken, and not tremble at the blow? who can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him plunged into any miserie, and not in compassion, and fellow-feeling communicate with him in his griefes? who sorroweth not at his friends losses; who groneth not in his sicknesse, and bleedeth not at his wounds? Or though any man should be so happie as to haue his friends also exempted from these miseries, or so potent to deliuer them; yet how is he afflicted with his death; grieuing with so much more sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, by how much he was more worthie of his loue; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reioycing that he so long had him, but lamenting that he hath now lost him, and that sweet comfort which he took in his society? all which miseries though they be somwhat cased with the contrary comforts, yet considering that the griefes of this life do so farre exceed the ioyes, and the crosses and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, the profits and delights, therefore it must needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, thath he who hath most friends, communicates in most miseries, and by compassion and fellow-feeling participates in most griefes and perturbations.</p>

Vnto which we may adde those which are specially belonging to all ages and estates; for no sooner haue we our being, then we be in miserie; and long before we breath the aire, we draw in corruption, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the poison of sin: before we can sinne we are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners▪ as being heires of our first parents transgression, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with our next parents corruptions; and we offend God, before we know what it is to offend him: for with our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents seed is mixed the seeds of all manner of sinne, and as we grow and wax strong, so sinne with vs groweth vntill it come to ful maturity. Euen in our first conception we also conceiue corruption; and then the foundation of wickednesse is laid, vpon which in the whole course of our life we build vp the strong holds of sinne. Then we are Atheists, Idolaters, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, Sabbath-breakers, adulterers, murtherers, theeues, false witnes-bearers, not by actuall transgression, but by an habituall disposition; and as we are said to be men, because we haue in vs the image of man, and seeds of humanitie, though we neuer did any manly action, seeing nothing is wanting but growth and maturitie: so by as good right we are called sinners of all kinds, because we haue the nature and very image of sinne, and the seeds of all corruptions li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in vs, which if we grow will grow with vs; and come to full ripenes, if we euer attaine vnto perfect age.

For no sooner are poore infants deliuered from the prison of the wombe, but they are presently bound hand and foot, and wholly at the dispose of others, as not hauing obtained liberty, but onely changed the prison and place of their restraint; and all the time of this infancie being without knowledge and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and darkened with more then brutish ignorance, is spent in naturall actions, eating, drinking, sleeping, crying and such like, being destitute of all worldly delights and comforts, and onely sensible in griefes and miseries. Next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:10731:304"/> infancie succeedeth childhood, which as it hath more sport and pleasure, so also more feare and danger; for no sooner can they goe, but presuming aboue their strength, they get many fals and bruises; and hauing legs to carrie them, and little wit to guide them, they are exposed to many casualties, and except they haue the better tendance, are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaken with many dangers. And when a few more yeeres are ouerpast, after they begin a little to rellish pleasures, and to take delight in sports and pastimes, presently they are checked in them by their superiours, and subiected to the gouernment of some master, who restraineth them of their liked liberty, and forceth them to follow their loathed stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And now being kept in awe, they begin to distast the bitternesse of limited liberty; and either play with feare, or learne with tedious wearinesse, hauing their eye on their booke, and their hearts on their pastimes, and being forced with feare to displease themselues, whilest vnwillingly they please their ouerseers, so that now againe they recall in their wishes the impotencie and ignorance of infancie, that they might also recouer their secure liberty: or finding that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, they set spurres to running time, and wish the end and death of this seruile age, that being set at liberty, they may be at their owne dispose without controll. Vnto which when they haue attained, and pulling their necke out of the yoke of subiection, haue together with the age the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges and liberty of youth, they are as farre from happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and full of miserie as they were before: for now it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with them as with the bird which hath been brought vp in the cage, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Or like a new backed colt, who hauing cast his rider, doth for a while with frollicke wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse course about the field, but being spent and tired, he wisheth himselfe in the stable, subiect againe to his masters

So these yonger prodigals, hauing shaken off the yoke of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and being wholly at their owne dispose, doe wildly runne many desperate courses, expose themselues to innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable dangers, and hauing neither the skill of getting nor care of keeping, they consume all in riot and voluptuous pleasure, till their state is brought to so low an ebbe, that they are ready to starue for want of necessaries, who before surfetted of superfluitie, and to be in truth fellow-commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with the hogs in their course fare of mast and draffe, who before were like vnto them in the allegorie, glutting themselues with pleasures, and wallowing in carnall and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall delights. And howsoeuer they haue now got a name of liberty, yet in truth they were neuer in the like thraldome; seeing they haue changed the gouernment of one father or master, into the tyrannie, or rather anarchie of innumerable passions: and reason being not yet seated in his throne, they are like the people of Israel without a king, who did nothing well, because they did euery one what they would; and whereas their other gouernours ruled with discretion, aimed at their good, restrained them from running on in licencious courses, and kept them in some good order; these new guides, like lords of misrule, leade them with headlong rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse into all desperate attempts, riot, excesse; and all kind of disorder, which seemeth but to promise the present fruition of some vaine delight.

For then vsually the soule is vexed, and the conscience troubled with the errors and crimes of ill-guided youth, and with the wrongs, deceits, and oppressions committed in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per age: then the body is tormented with the rushes and bruises taken in youthfull sports, and violent exercises, enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the cares, watchings, and labours sustained in that age which is accounted most perfect, and punished for the intemperance, voluptuousnes, surfetting and excesse of them both, with innumerable sicknesses and diseases: then is the time when palsies, gouts, stone, strangurie, collicke and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable such like tortures chiefly sway: then the head shaketh, the backe stoopeth, the ioynts tremble, the limmes

Yea rather (setting aside our spirituall comforts, and future hopes) that they of all men are most miserable, as<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 19.</note>
                  <pb n="545" facs="tcp:10731:308"/> the Apostle speaketh. For besides that they haue a large share in those miseries which are commonly incident to other men; they haue certaine others proper and peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; for no sooner hath our Sauiour Christ chosen them<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 19.</note> out of the world, but presently it professeth against them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen emnitie, it enuieth their prosperity, and plotteth their ruine; it scorneth, derideth, backbiteth and slandereth them; it wrongeth, oppresseth, afflicteth and persecuteth them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them before the iudgement seates, accusing, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and killing them for the profession of Gods truth. So that our Sauiour Christ might well say peculiarly of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue others, that <hi>in the world they shall haue trouble;</hi> because<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 33.</note> none in the world are so troubled. Vnto these we may adde the griefes which their righteous soules doe suffer in seeing the abominations committed by these cursed Sodomites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom they liue; as when they behold Gods worship neglected, and idolatrie erected, some adoring images, and some making an idoll of the world; the holy name of God blasphemed, his Sabbaths prophaned, authority despised, gouernment disordered, murthers committed &amp; pardoned, the whole land defiled with tolerated filthinesse. When they shall see all preferments attained by bribing and corruption: In the places of iudgement, iustice peruerted, truth wrested, equitie contemned, the guilty acquitted, the guiltlesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, wrong maintained and right suppressed; and all things caried with fauour and respect of persons. And among priuate men cruelty and oppression bearing sway, euery shop full of lying and deceit, euery street full of pride and vanity, and almost euery man abhorring simplicity and faithfull dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and affecting the art of dissimulation, hypocrisie, tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, double dealing, complementall friendship, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised emnitie. What a griefe, I say, must this needs bring to a child of God, to see his heauenly father thus dishonoured, and his lawes neglected, and troden vnder foot? yea when hee shall behold those most aduanced and respected in the world, who most dishonour God by running on in the course of wickednesse? when he shall see him who hath vsed most deceit most enriched, and hee who is most rich most
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:10731:309"/> esteemed, the world measuring his goodnesse according to his goods, and not his vertues; when hee beholdeth the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressour, extortioner, vsurer, who should stand at the barre, sitting on the iudgement seate; the rich foole made a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate to rule others, who hath not wit enough to gouerne himselfe; the poet and player more esteemed then the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preacher; the ambitious aduanced, hauing nothing to raise them but their pride and impudencie, whereby they haue resolued that they will rise; the humble, though neuer so worthie, neglected and kept vnder; audacious boldnesse hauing free entrance, when as modesty is repelled and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; the parasite and flatterer much esteemed, and hee who faithfully admonisheth and speaketh the truth from his hart, hated and disgraced. But besides the griefe which the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sustaine in beholding the sinnes of professed worldlings, they are much more vexed with the scandalous liues and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarie sins of those who are the professours of Gods true religion; whenas they who daily heare the word, make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of an oth, abstaine from the vnprofitable corruptions of the time, and make some outward reformation in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie; are neuerthelesse as proud and phantasticall in their apparell, as vnfaithfull to their friend, as false in their word and promise, as deceitfull in their dealing, as backeward in all workes of mercy, and as couetous in all their courses, as the prophane contemners of all religion.

Besides all which griefes which haue an outward ground; they haue inward causes of much miserie, trouble, and bitter sorrow. For they are continually exercised in that
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:10731:309"/> dangerous conflict against the spirituall enemies of their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; Satan daily like a roaring Lion seeketh to deuour them, by suggesting into their minds wicked temptations, wherby he allureth them to lose their soules by sinne, for the hire of some worldly vanities; the world maligneth them, and allureth them vnto euill by offering some pleasing baits, or discourageth them from that which is good by troubles and persecutions: the flesh lusteth continually against the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and maketh them to do the euill they hate, and to neglect the good which they like and loue. In which spirituall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare they are alwaies troubled, and often foiled, being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with tentation, and led captiue vnto sin. And this is the last and greatest miserie wherewith the faithfull are in this life afflicted and molested, in that they are through the strength of their enemies, and violence of their owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, often besides their purpose ouertaken of sinne, and thereby offend their gratious God, whose displeasure they shun as the greatest euill.</p>

For let a man but set his hart vpon these vanities, and with what cares is he presently turmoiled? with what hopes and feares is he continually racked? with what enuie, emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, iealousie, rage, hatred, and contention is he forthwith wholly possessed? spending part of his time in madde mirth, when he hath his desires; and a greater part in sad melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie, because he is crossed of his hopes; one while ouer ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and snatched vp into the clouds with rauishing admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and soone after suddenly deiected with discontent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he can ascend no higher in the pursuit of those things which chiefely affect him. Thus he who taketh all his paines in sowing the seeds of honor, hath neuer a haruest that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth his greedie expectation, but hauing sowen the wind of vaine-glorie, he reapeth the whirle-wind of trouble and vexation, as the Prophet speaketh: for his head is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Hosea 8. 7.</note> turmoiled with cares to rise higher, and with feares lest missing footing in his climing, he fall from that height vnto which he is alreadie aspired: euery honor which he misseth is vnto him a grieuous disgrace: the not vncouering of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours head, is a corrasiue to his heart; and the greatest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor doth not bring vnto him any ioy and comfort, when as<note place="margin">Hester. 5. 9. 11.</note> he is but touched with the least contempt: the least frowne of his Prince, as a piercing sword, inflicteth such a deepe wound into his heart, that all the smoothing tongues of his fawning flatterers cannot make it whole againe with their often licking; only it is the renued beames of the Princes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, that can do away these clouds of sorrow.

And yet so foolish we are that we neglect these rich treasures of spirituall grace, and eternall ioy, which God (to take away all excuse) hath offered vnto vs freely and franckly without money, and with little labour ioyned with much comfort; and with all eagernesse pursue these worldly trifles which cannot be obtained without much paines and toilesome tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell; like little boyes who with great delight spend their sweate in catching a butterflie; but are straight tired though they sit easily at their books to get learning, and neuer take the least thought in securing vnto themselues the title which they haue to their inheritance.</p>
               <p>The which follie is so much the greater, in that men doe<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. That worldly men take their chiefe paines for superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities.</hi>

For those things which are necessary to nature, and to the preseruation of life, as meate and drinke, clothing and lodging; aire, fire,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 3.</note> water, and the rest, are giuen liberally by God to those who take some moderate paines in their lawfull callings, and they lie out in common without inclosure, to bee obtained with ease by those that need them: but superfluities are not so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silie compassed, being either hid and not found without great search, or inclosed about with so many difficulties, that men cannot approch them without great paines and danger. For example, the mines of gold and siluer are hid in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret cauernes of the earth; precious stones, in the sea &amp; sands; gorgeous clothes bought at deare rates, and delicious meats with much cost and paines procured, and with no lesse coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and prepared.

<pb n="552" facs="tcp:10731:312"/> extreame danger gotten and obtained; yet men willingly take all this paines, and boldly hazard themselues to all these perils: But though grace be freely offered without money, and heauen opened to all that desire, and but striue to enter; yet the most neglect the one, as not worth the receiuing; and lose the other, because they had rather not haue it, then take the least paines in trauelling to it. Yea so are men besot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the loue of worldly vanities, that they take all these paines and endure these restlesse labours with pleasure and delight, which otherwise would be intolerable; and as it is said of <hi>Iacob</hi> louing <hi>Rachel,</hi> they thinke many yeeres but a few daies which is spent in compassing these things which they so fondly affect, that if this dotage supported them not, would be irksomely tedious. They are in such hast in running after these trifles, that though they tread vpon prickles and briars they feele no hurt; so greatly do they thirst after these worldly vanities, that though they bee made bitter with toilesome labour, yet they greedily swallow them with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing delight; and as the oxe accustomed to draw in the yoke, doth after he is loosed, againe yeeld his necke vnto it of his owne accord, without compulsion; so these men being inured to the worlds slauerie, though they were set at libertie out of this thraldome, would againe voluntarily take vpon them the yoke of seruitude, and weare themselues out with toile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some labour, to attaine the vncertain possession of these mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany vanities.</p>

Now if we further consider that these weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some labours of the body, are commonly ioyned with the sin of the soule, and that as they bring to the one temporarie troubles, so to the other eternall torments, if they be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by serious repentance, we may iustly conclude that in this respect also they are truely miserable. For what greater miserie can be imagined then to toile for that which is not worth our paines, and after all our labour to giue our soules to boot, for the procuring of these trifling vanities? to sell our soules vnto sinne, and by sin vnto death, which the whole world cannot redeeme when they are once lost? For if it will not profit vs by the losse of them to gaine the whole world, as our Sauiour speaketh; then how wretched is their estate,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 26.</note> who sustaine by sinning this vnrecouerable losse, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of some small pittance, &amp; slender share of the worlds vanities? But who seeth not that few of many compasse these worldly things by honest and lawfull meanes; but take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct and sinfull courses for the atchieuing of their ends? Some wronging others by violence, oppression, trecherie, and subtiltie, fraud and deceit; and almost all wronging
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:10731:313"/> themselues with vnmeasurable toyle, and carking care, spending their strength, and hastening their death, for the obtaining of these earthly trifles: whereby also they grieuously sinne against God, not onely by destroying his creature, but by dishonouring the Creator, whilest wholly resting vpon their owne care and labour, and vsing their owne meanes, they denie his prouidence, and refuse to be ordred in their courses by his directions prescribed in his word; as though either he were ignorant and knew not their wants, or carelesse and did not regard them; or insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and not able to relieue them; whereas in truth, he seeth all, ruleth all, and hath enough in store for all that depend vpon him: so that as the Wise man saith, <hi>in the feare of the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esay 5. 18.</note>
                  <hi>Lord is an assured strength, and his children shall haue hope:</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he neither wanteth knowledge, power, nor will to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for them. And thus do men draw vnto themselues ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie with the cords of these worldly vanities, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet speaketh, swallowing vnder these baites the hidden hookes of sin, and receiuing these earthly trifles as the wages of wickednes; whereby they eternally lose themselues, for the temporarie gaine of worldly vanities. And yet so foolish men are, that they conceiue not of this miserable losse; but thinke only those things deare which are bought with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and those cheape for which they sell their soules; that losse alone which diminisheth their outward estate; and that aduantage, which addeth to their stocke, though it robbeth them of themselues, and their owne saluation: and whereas they would refuse many things which they desire vpon the base price of some little money, they will not sticke to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase it by sin, wrong, iniurie, oppression, lying and deceit, though thereby they hazard body and soule to hell and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death: whereby it appeareth how highly men prize these worldly trifles, and how meanely they esteeme themselues, seeing they are readie to make exchange vpon all occasions; and to make sale of their soules to buy these vanities.</p>

And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of these and many other sins, which vsually accompany riches in respect of their getting, they are called by one wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked riches; and by our Sauiour Christ, the mammon of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie: and in this regard also they are compared vnto thornes, because as when they are hastily catched they woūd the hand, so these the consciences of those who greedily seaze vpon them; and vnto snares, which being couered with a bait, inthrall vs whilest they allure vs; for he who greedily<note place="margin">Gregor.

<pb n="558" facs="tcp:10731:315"/> being taken like a bird, when with an hungrie eie he behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the baite of earthly things, he is vnwittingly strangled with the snare of sin. Hence also it is that couetousnes by the Apostle is said to be the root of all euill; and by another it is<note place="margin">1. Tim▪ 6. 10. Bion. Sophista apud Stobaeum.</note> called the metropolis, or mother citie of all vice and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, because where it is intertained, thither also all manner of sin resorteth, and as it were keepeth continuall tearme. In regard of which sins vsually accompanying riches, in respect of the vnlawfull meanes which are ordinarily vsed in their getting, one doubteth not to affirme that a rich man is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diues est ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quus, aut iniqui haeres.</hi> Hieron. in Ier. 6.</note> himselfe, or the heire of one which is vnrighteous: which though it be not alwaies so, yet it seldome faileth in those who immoderately louing wealth, resolue with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues that they will be rich; and making haste to satisfie their greedie desire with all possible speed, doe in short time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish that they wish: for as sudden fulnesse and fatnesse is an vndoubted signe of the ill disposition of the bodie; so when as a man suddenly waxeth great, and (as I may say) fat in his state, by ordinarie meanes, and by his owne industrie and labour, it is an argument more then probable, that his mind is full of the grosse humours of sin. Of the former the Apostle saith, that <hi>they who will be rich</hi> (that is, pitch and resolue vpon<note place="margin">1.

The which trouble and restlesse vexation the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth,<note place="margin">Esa. 57. 20.</note> by comparing wicked worldlings to <hi>the raging sea that cannot rest, whose waters cast vp mire and dirt.</hi> Now the cause of this care and feare in the keeping of these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanities, is the immoderate loue which their owners beare vnto them; for as we securely possesse those things which we little regard: so if once wee set our heart vpon any thing though neuer so vaine, wee are presently tormented with a iealous care in keeping it, and feare of losing it. And as little children are neuer at quiet when they are fond of any body in the familie, but crie after them as soone as they see them, and when they haue their companie, crie as much if they but seeme to stirre, for feare of losing them; so if we once waxe fond of these worldly vanities, wee possesse them with such
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:10731:317"/> care and feare, lest they should bee taken from vs, that they bring vs much more disquietnesse and griefe, then comfort and contentment in their fruition. Neither can wee euer se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely enioy any worldly thing, or take delight in it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out molestation, vnlesse louing it lesse then we loue our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and possessing it with a desire moderated by his will, we bee content to retaine it as long as it pleaseth him, and can part with it willingly, when it is his pleasure to take it away; for when we loue the world or any thing in it with vnlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted affection, and affect the creature, more then the Creator, it is iust with the Lord, that this excessiue loue should be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with excessiue cares and feares, and that by immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate louing, we should lose the comfort of our loue. Now if any shall say that they feele no such torment or molestation through these cares and feares; let them know that it is not the want of a burthen which procureth their ease, but their madnesse of affection which maketh them senselesse in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the waight: it is not for want of trouble that they are so well contented, but because their foolish loue causeth them to mistake crosses for comforts, and turneth torments into delights. Like those who are wel pleased to haue their backs almost broken, whilest they are loaded with gold; or vnto such as being diseased with the dropsie, take their chiefe pleasure in drinking, though it bee the chiefe cause of their paines and torments.</p>
               <p>But how many miseries accompanie these worldly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 10.

                  </note> it may more plainely appeare, if wee insist in the speciall instances: for first as honours are begotten, borne and bred by perils and labours; so are they by the same nursed and preserued; neither can glorious fame bee long maintained, vnlesse it be vpheld by watching care, and painefull labour: and as those who climbe vp the high and steepe rocke of honour, must before they can get vp spend much sweate, and be euen tired with their laborious trauell, so being come to the top, they shall stand as it were vpon a narrow ridge, and find but tickle and slipperie footing, whereby they shall be in danger of falling, vnlesse they haue a good braine, and a carefull eye. And this causeth those who are aduanced to
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:10731:317"/> high places, to bee iealous and suspitious of all that stand about them, not thinking what they will doe, but what they can doe, nor what presently they vndertake, but what they may attempt in time to come; making their power of infringing their glorie, to bee vnto them a continuall terror, as if alreadie they were assaulted. They feare those who are vnder them, lest they pull them downe, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues may more easily ascend; those that are their equals, and as it were on euen ground, lest they should iustle them out of the path of honor, and crosse or ouerthrow them by competition, as being corriuals in the same loue; and much more do they stand in feare of those who are aboue them, lest they should crush and tread them vnder foot, hauing the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of the vpper ground. So that the ambitious man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with great paines ascended to the steepe top of honors hill, findeth himselfe not exempted, from the stormie tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests of troubles &amp; dangers, but rather exposed to them; and these high cedars are more often blasted, and shattered with thunders and lightnings, then the lowest shrubs. Which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils howsoeuer many escape yet few or none the feare; for as the thunder-bolt striking but one or two, doth affright and terrifie all those who stand about them; so when those who are highly aduanced, haue their greatnes ruined and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, by those who are higher then they, or by the furie of popular rage, or because it is no longer able to bear it own waight, those haue their part in the feare, though not in the danger, who are of the same qualitie and estate. Moreouer, adde vnto these feares and cares the manifold molestations, and fretting griefes, which are incident to those who are of honorable condition, whilest they vindicate their reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vpholding and preseruing those honors which alreadie they haue receiued, or aspire vnto new preferments, being distracted betweene hope and feare of rising; whilest they enuie their superiours, emulate their equals, and magnifie themselues to their inferiours. Euery checke of their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne woundeth their heart, euery repulse or disgrace crush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and breaketh it: they are vexed with euery salutation which they giue vnto their equals, if they be not resaluted;
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:10731:318"/> they are tormented if their inferiours faile in dutifull respect; and if any out strip them who was behind in this glorious race, they sinke downe with sorrow, and eat their hearts with griefe: they are tormented if they doe not ouer-top all in height and greatnes; and though they be too high alreadie, they haue little ioy in their aduancement, vnlesse they can rise to the full pitch of their proud hopes: often they desire to do euill; and yet are fearefull that it should be discouered; and louing those courses of pride, insolence and tyranni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Finally, the couetous rich man is afraid of all things, sauing Gods displeasure; and of losing all, except it be his owne soule, and the ioyes of heauen: and such is his folly, that whilest he feareth to lose his gold, riches, lands and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, he is in no feare of losing himselfe, as though (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting his owne person) he had nothing in his custodie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie the keeping. Hence it is that he keepeth such a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row watch ouer his wealth, and hauing inclosed and shut it vp vnder the sure custodie of many bolts, iron bard chests, and strong lockes, which neither picking nor breaking can indanger, he addeth also to his aid so many seruants, as his couetous mind will suffer him to maintaine, that they may the better keepe the watch, and bring securitie; but all in vaine, for within a while he groweth iealous of his guard, and suspitious of his assistants; and the more able they are to keep out outward violence, the more stronger he thinketh them
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:10731:319"/> to breake open his chests, and to spoile him of his treasures; and therfore thinking no knowne strength sufficient to keep his gold and siluer from force or fraud, hee hideth it in the ground, being ready to suspect his eyes and heart, as priuie to his secrecie, lest imparting it to his tongue, it should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale it at vnawares either waking or sleeping. And as one of the ancients noteth, such is the madnesse of these greedie muck wormes, that after they haue with sweating paines,<note place="margin">Basil. orat. 14. de diuitijs &amp; paupertate.</note> searched for their treasures in the bowels of the earth, they are ready with shiuering feare to hide and couer them in the earth again; like the adders yong, which being newly come out of their dams bellie, glide and returne into it for safety, when as they are frighted with any danger. Yea and as though notwithstanding all this, it were not safe enough, they are ready (as one saith) to lie ouer the place in which<note place="margin">

In a word, as they neuer thinke their money free from danger, so are they neuer free from feare, they neuer securely eate or sleepe, but as the holy martyr said, they sigh at their banquets, although they drinke in the richest plate; and after their feasts, when they haue laid downe their bodies made leane with cares, and euen hid them in their beds of downe, they watch and can take no rest in their soft lodging; and when but a mouse stirreth, they are ready to bustle vp, suspecting a theefe; not vnderstanding, wretches that they are, that all their wealth doth but bring vnto thē glorious punishments, that they are fettered with their gold, and possessed of their riches, whilest they thinke they possesse them. The which follie of ouer carefull keeping their wealth, as it is in all sottish and absurd, so it is most ridiculous, and yet most common in old men; which though they haue alreadie one foot in the graue, yet doe they in this kind shew their foolish feare more then any other; burying their treasures in the earth, not long before themselues are buried, as though howsoeuer they neuer had any good of them in this life, yet they were in some hope to haue it in the life to come. The which dotage befalleth men through the iust iudgement of God; for when as they
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:10731:320"/> neglect the loue of their Creator, who is loued without any labour, he giueth them ouer to dote vpon the creature which they loue with laborious paines, and enioy with many griefs; being ready at the command of their concupiscence, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure all labours and dangers for the obtaining of it; and to what purpose? surely that they may fil their chests with trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,<note place="margin">August.

To which purpose one saith, that couetousnesse desireth gold, sorrowfull labour findeth it out, and carking care keepeth it: It is the matter of labours, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous to the possessours, a weakener of vertue, an ill master, and trecherous seruant; no man thinketh that he hath it safe, vnlesse hee alwaies hide it, because it shineth to the owners destruction; in darkenesse it is sought, and it is kept in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And the reason of all these miseries is, because men make idols of their wealth, and loue it out of measure; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can that be securely possessed which is excessiuely ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualued; whereas if louing God aboue all, they could in all estates bee content with that which pleaseth him: if in the time of prosperity and plentie, they would learne the vanity of abundance, and make pouertie familiar vnto them, not onely by meditation, but by accustoming and inuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to indure some want, they would inioy their riches with much more securitie, and entertaine pouertie, if it happen to seaze vpon them, with much more patience and contentation.</p>

To make vs<note place="margin">1.

Or if our affections cannot bee withdrawne from this earthly mammon, let vs as our Sauiour Christ exhorteth vs, labour<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 9.</note> to make friends of it, which we may doe if we vse it friendly, and loue it truely, as it ought to bee loued, and wee to loue. Now riches are truely loued when we vse them in their kind, and according to their owne nature, helping them forward to the attaining of their chiefe and best end, for which they were created; euen as we are said to loue bookes best, when
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:10731:321"/> we euen weare them out with studying; and meat best, when with a good stomacke we feed vpon it; and our neighbours best, when we moue them to glorifie God in their saluation; because these are the maine ends for which they were made. But the chiefe end of riches is that we may glorifie God in their vse; as when we imploy part of them to the necessarie and sufficient maintenance of our selues, and those who are committed to our charge; and that which remaineth, to the releeuing, feeding and cloathing of the poore members of Iesus Christ, which is the maine end of our plentie and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie; from which end also they haue their name, being called goods, because they inable vs to doe good, and are the instruments of well doing: and therefore they who hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them of these ends, and will not vse them according to their owne nature, which is to do good, by being communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to those who stand in need, but keepe them fast locked vp (as it were) in close prison, not suffering their gold and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to be at libertie, which were created and ordained to be (as we also call them) currant money, passing from man to man, as need requireth, they can neither be said to loue their riches, nor yet themselues; because altering their vse and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they make them to degenerate, and ceasing to be good and profitable, they cause them through their abuse to be hurtfull and pernicious. In which respect they are compared to bandogs, which are most fierce when they are tied vp, but gentle when they are set at libertie; and to riuers, which if they be suffered to haue their naturall course in their owne current, they runne quietly and do much good to the whole countrie, but if any will stop their course, as desiring to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosse them to his owne vse, they rage and swell, breake downe their bankes, and drowne all that are about them: or<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Matth. 13.

<pb n="572" facs="tcp:10731:322"/> in their way, they will retaine their naturall puritie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, being vsed in their kind; but if we imprison and hord them vp, they will corrupt and become vnprofitable, yea in truth noysome, hurtfull and pernicious: thus cloathes laid vp become moth-eaten, corne reserued ouer-long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth mustie and vnsauourie; meate kept past due time putrifieth and stincketh, and coine it selfe being hoorded vp and not vsed, loseth it beautie and brightnes, and is fretted with rust and canker; and that which is worst of all, these moth-eaten garments, corrupted riches, and cankered gold and siluer, shall be a witnesse against those who thus abuse them, eate their flesh as fire, and for their false and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full imprisonment, shall cast them into the prison of vtter darknes, as our Sauiour Christ and his holy Apostle haue<note place="margin">Iames 5. 1. 2. 3.

               <p>If therefore we truly loue riches, or our selues, let vs not<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 14. That riches are most surely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued when they are giuen to the poore.</hi>

Now this we shall do if we enioy part of them to our owne comfort, and communicate the ouerplus to the good of others, feeding the hungrie, clothing the naked, and relieuing those who any way stand in need. For we lose these earthly riches in keeping them, and keepe them in bestowing them; if we giue them we shall euer inioy them; if we reserue them, we shall surely lose them; seeing we cannot long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with them; for either they shall be taken from vs, or we from them, carrying nothing with vs out of the world, but returning naked as we came into it. So that if we would haue these perishing things permanent vnto vs, we must giue them that we may alwaies haue them; and leaue them for a time, that we may enioy them for euer.

If we would haue our corne continue sweet and good for a great space, let vs know that there are for this purpose no garners cōparable to poore mens stomackes, which will preserue our graine for our vse vnto life eternall: if we would haue our clothes preserued from mothes, and to last long, the backs of the naked are our safest wardrops: if we would keepe our gold and siluer from rusting and cankering, let vs commit it to the custodie of the poore, and they will not only keep it bright, but become our porters to carie it before vs vnto heauen; whereas whatsoeuer they beare not for vs we shall surely leaue behind vs. In a word, if we would be rich truly and eternally, let vs as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ counselleth vs, <hi>not lay vp our treasures vpon the earth, where the moth and canker corrupt, and where theeues dig through and steale, but let vs lay vp our treasures in heauen,</hi>

It followeth that I ad briefly a word or two of worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, which as they are gotten with labour and paine, so they are kept with much trouble and feare. For what care doe they bring to those who set their hearts on them to continue them so, that they may neither be wanting to their appetite, nor their appetite to them? How curiously doe they diet themselues one day, that the day following they may bee more able, and (as it were) better breathed, to runne on in their voluptuous courses? How discontented are they when hauing pleasures they can take no pleasure in them, because they are cloyed, and haue already surfetted of their delights? How are they vexed if they doe not answere their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor please their wanton pallet, when as oftentimes there is no want in their pleasures, but because they being glutted with satiety cannot rellish them? How are they turmoiled whilest they feele an inward conflict betweene voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and desire of honour, and stand in feare lest by inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:10731:324"/> their pleasures, they lose their credit and reputation, when either they are in themselues vnlawfull, or in their vse immoderate? What inward pangs feele they, when their consciences tell them that their voluptuous courses will not agree with religion, and the feare of God, no nor yet with ciuility and common honesty? and what remorse and stings of repentance doe they endure, when the sweetnesse of their pleasures are ouerpast; though they are so bewitched with these pleasing sorceries, that with the drunkard in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs, after they haue found themselues sicke, and surfetted<note place="margin">Pro. 23. 35.</note> of their delights, and euen beaten with the scourges of many miseries, they continue in their voluptuous courses, and with no lesse fondnes then before dote vpon their pleasures? Finally, whereas the temperate man who hath learned to abound and to want, doth securely enioy his delights, as not greatly valuing them, because hee can as well bee without them as with them; contrariwise hee that is voluptuous, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing set his heart vpon these bewitching vanities, and made an idoll of his pleasures, is in continuall feare of losing that which hee so much loueth; and when hee aboundeth with those things which his heart desireth, his reioicing is not so great in their fruition, as his feares, ielousies, and suspitions, lest in time to come, hee should bee depriued of them. And howsoeuer these carnall pleasures are but base vanities and childish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And hauing reposed in them all their ioy and comfort, their hope and confidence, when with <hi>Laban</hi> they are robbed of their idols, they lament their losse with more true griefe, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine this burthen with much more impatiency, then if they were at once spoiled of their wife, children, and all their<note place="margin">Gen. 31.</note> friends; because they are together with them robbed also of their hearts, which are fast nailed, and inseparablie affixed to them. Neither in this case is the worth of the thing lost to be considered, but the affection and estimation of him that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it; for those things which are possessed with immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate loue, are lost with immoderate griefe, although in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues they are vaine and worthles: euen as we see little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren lamenting with no lesse true sorrow the taking away of their childish and contemptible trifles, then if they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of their inheritance. So in like maner, worldy men o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerualuing earthly vanities aboue their worth, are more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with griefe when they are forced to forgoe them, then for losing the glorious inheritance of the faints, and the eternall ioyes of heauen. Yea their sorrow is so intolerable oftentimes, that to ease their griefe, they murther themselues; as thinking lesse torment in death, yea in hell it selfe, then in liuing to sustaine so great a losse. For the greater they conceited their happinesse in the fruition of their vaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, the more miserable they thinke themselues when they are depriued of it; and now they hartily wish that they had neuer enioyed these pleasures, because at the last they are spoiled of them; though in truth with great follie, for they hauing had formerly the fruition of their desires, might, were it not for their owne peeuishnesse, still delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with the remembrance of it, and when they are most destitute and forsaken of the things they loued, they are (setting passion and opinion aside) in no worse case, then before they had them: yea sometime men are thus affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:10731:325"/> with bitter sorrow, when as they are depriued but of some small part of these worldly things, though they haue still the greatest share left behind; neither can their great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder so much delight them, as their little losse grieueth them, as though their ioy and comfort were bound ioyntly to all, and seuerally to euery part of these vanities, so that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part be wanting, a forfeiture must presently be made of the whole summe: wherein they may fitly be compared to little children, who though they haue twentie trifles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they play, yet if but one of them be taken away without their consent, do presently fall a crying, and in a moodie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content cast away all the rest, taking no delight in many, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they may still haue all: yea oftentimes it commeth to passe, that though they make but meane account of a thing whilest they haue it, yet they value it when they must forgo<note place="margin">Stultus quod perdidit, ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="583" facs="tcp:10731:327"/> and in our affection and practise with much more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie and earnestnesse loue and seeke them; seeing these are certaine and permanent, and the other most vncertaine and tickle, and that both in respect of getting and keeping them. For though we should vse all indeuour, and spend all our strength in seeking and searching for these worldly things, we are not sure with all our labour to obtaine them: And though we should get them into our possession, yet haue we no assurance to retaine and keepe them. Concerning the former, we find by continuall experience that the sweat of worldlings is not alwaies fruitfull, but after that they haue beaten their braines, wearied their bodies, and consumed their strength with working, watching, and continuall car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and caring; yet are they oftentimes at the end of their liues, as farre from the end of all their labours, as when they first began. We see many daily like greedie kites, snatching and striking continually at the prey, and yet misse of it after<note place="margin">Wisd. 9. 14.</note> all their earnest indeauours, howsoeuer many times they pierce themselues vpon the pikes of tentations and sinne, which Satan like a cunning fowler hath hidden vnder these worldly baites for their destruction.

Neither is this any great wonder: for all in the world is nothing neere sufficient to affoord plentie of these things so much desired, to all that seeke them; and therefore the same thing hauing many competitors, it must of necessity fall out as it doth in hunting, that one starteth the game, and another catcheth it; and as the prouerbe is, a man cannot thriue for throng of his neighbors. Yea in truth, themselues doe crosse themselues, their desires being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie one to another, as affecting things which will not stand together; for at once they would take their pleasures, and heape vp riches, and be glorious in the world for their bountie and liberality, and so griping more then they can hold, oftentimes they retaine but little, and sometime lose
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:10731:328"/> all. And as when diuers contrarie winds meet, they cause a whirle wind, whereby all is scattered and dispersed: so they entertaining desires, the one crossing and conflicting with another, they scatter those things which they desire to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus the voluptuous man would inioy his pleasures and his riches too; but as ths Wise man saith, hee <hi>that loueth pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime shall be a poore man, and he that loueth wine and oyle, shall</hi>

<pb n="587" facs="tcp:10731:330"/> haue had in themselues from time to time; still hoping for better, till they cease to be. And though hauing past a great part of their life they haue found no cause why they should<note place="margin">How men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude themselues with false hopes.</note> desire to liue; yea haue inioyed so small comfort and been turmoiled with so many miseries, that if it were put to their choice they would not care to liue, if they might liue no better; yet in hope of amending their estate, and of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto some new happinesse, which they haue not yet inioyed; they are in loue with life and the world still; though commonly they neuer obtaine the things hoped for; or if they do, yet they haue their new hopes so attended on with new miseries, that when they come they bring little comfort: for vpon the accesse of new benefits which they haue long desired, either they lose the old, which were more in number and better in worth; or else are ouertaken with some vnthought of euils, which diswelcome their new-come guests, and turne all their sweet into gall and bitternesse. And as those who trauel, though they haue found the waies which they haue alreadie passed, foule and vncomfortable, and those in which they presently are, no more faire and pleasant, yet casting their eyes a good distance before them, and seeing the fields greene and plaine in shew, conceiue hope of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, and imagine that they shall end their iorney with more delight; but all in vaine: for when they come vnto it, they find the ground wet and rotten, and many slowes and lakes which before they approached them, they could not discouer: so we trauailing in our pilgrimage, and hauing in our trauell experience of the miseries which we haue found in our childhood and youth; seeing before vs riper and elder age seemingly pleasant, in respect of that plentie and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie which doth accompanie them, together with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of wife and children, and such other benefits; doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently conceiue a deceiuing hope of some future happinesse, when we shall enioy those things which so long before we did expect: but often we are altogether frustrate of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, or if we attaine vnto them, we find the faire field in shew to be nothing in proofe but bogs and marish grounds; and that the life which we so much liked, is so full of cares and
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:10731:331"/> feares, troubles and discontents, infirmities and aches, sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and diseases, that we are readie vpon trial to conclude, that we haue but exchanged the frying-pan for the fire, and that as in a quagmire, whilest we haue gotten one foot out of the dirt, the other is faster and deeper in. Now what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son there is why men should after this manifold experience both in themselues and others, still deceiue themselues with vaine hopes, I can render no other, but that they for their owne parts are willing to be thus deceiued, and dare not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that which in truth they are to find, lest their life should be altogether vncomfortable and miserable before the time, when as they haue not so much as hope to assist thē, &amp; make their burthens tollerable: and therefore rather then they will haue no hope to beare them company in their miseries, they are readie to admit of such as are deceiueable and ill groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; that these false hopes may bring vnto them some true comforts, and small refreshings, though they continue only for the present. And God for his part is cōtented to let them continue in this blindnes or wilfull winking; and to haue these false and deceiuing hopes alwaies attending on them; that wicked men abusing themselues with their owne sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie, may go on in their courses to their perdition; and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest they hope to attaine vnto these worldly things which they so dotingly loue, neuer labour to attaine vnto better hopes, nor to assure themselues of euerlasting happines; and partly that they might not hurt humane societie, nor in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire lay violent hands vpon themselues, when as they should be forsaken of all hope to receiue contentment, either in things appertaining to this life or the life to come. Yea and whereas Gods dearest seruants being partly flesh and partly spirit, as they haue the spirituall part cheered and comforted in the time of their pilgrimage, with the assured hopes of future happinesse, so the fleshly part admitteth of no refreshing or contentment, but that which is receiued from things present; therefore God thought it fit to suffer them also to entertaine some worldly hopes, lest the flesh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vtterly frustrate of it chiese desires, might with excessiue murmuring, repining and discontent, be too heauie a clog
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:10731:331"/> to the spirituall man, and too much discomfort him in his way to heauen, being to trauell as in a desolate wildernesse, and hauing no hope of conuenient lodging, and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble entertainment as he is going on his iourney. Whereas hauing for the present but an ill welcome to the world, and many an hungrie meale and hard lodging, yet still being in hope of better, it lesse strugleth and resisteth, but suffereth him to go on, if not with more patience and agreement, yet with lesse impatiencie and opposition.</p>
               <p>And thus you see that though we should set our minds<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. That worldlings do often by their too earnest la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring lose the fruit of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi>

For those who graspe most greedily these waterish vanities, do hold least of them in their hands; and they who serue the world with all paines, and laborious industrie, are oftentimes by this vnthankfull master punished for their ouermuch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and lose their reward, because they haue bin too ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest in their busines, and ouer laboured themselues in doing their worke, hauing now only their labour for their paines, and in stead of their wished wages, nothing else but griefe and miserie. Others there are whom the world seemeth to vse with more fauour in the beginning, not only giuing them intertainment with a smiling countenance, but also putting earnest into their hands, and after some seruice done vnto it, paying them liberally (as it were) their first quarters wages: but after they (being incouraged with this liberall
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:10731:332"/> pay) do with more diligence performe their busines, in hope<note place="margin">Certa amitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, dum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerla petimus.</note> of greater reward, for their greater labour, it quite frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them of their hopes, and not only denieth to giue them more, but also taketh from them that they haue. For how many are there, who by their moderate labours hauing got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten many things, do in more eager seeking after more, lose that which they alreadie haue? How many do we see daily before our eyes, who lose their certainties, whilest they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for vncertainties, and not thinking that they haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, when they haue too much, do in ouer reaching catch a spreine, and whilest they greedily seeke after superfluities, do lose not their sufficiencie alone, but euen necessaries? And this commeth to passe, not only because the world is vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vnthankfull to those that serue it, but also because it is impotent and insufficient: for howsoeuer it is readie (like Satan the prince thereof) to vndertake great matters, and to make large promises, that it may moue men to leaue the Lord, and leane vnto it, yet the truth is, that though it were willing, yet it is altogether vnable to performe; for <hi>the earth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm. 24. 1.</note>
                  <hi>is the Lords, and all that therein is,</hi> and he giueth to the sons of men, as it seemeth best to his infinit wisdome: so that though the world brag neuer so much of it possessions, and great abilitie; and proudly arrogating vnto it selfe Gods royall priuiledges, doth what it can to rob him of his right; yet the truth is, that it hath not the worth of a penie at ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute command, because euen the least matters are gouerned and disposed by diuine prouidence; neither is it the painfull indeuors of greedie worldlings, that can compasse the things which they so much desire; seeing they wholly proceed from the blessing of God; for as the Psalmist hath taught vs, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi>

<pb n="591" facs="tcp:10731:332"/> it is not able to giue them their wages. Whereby the way wee may note the miserable seruitude of a wretched worldling; for God will not reward him because hee hath renounced his seruice, and the world cannot, hauing nothing to dispose of; onely it cosoneth him with base shifts, and with alluring promises inticeth him to spend his strenghth in vaine, hauing after all his painfull seruice nothing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow vpon him.</p>

How many haue earnestly striuen to enter the gate of honour, whereof some haue been troden vnder foot in the presse, others thrust backe by some more strong then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, others haue stucke fast in the gate by reason of the crowd, and few haue entred, besides such as haue climbed ouer other mens sholders, making themselues high by the downfals of other men, and erecting trophees to their owne praise, vpon the ruines of other mens fame? Will you haue examples? The old world would needs build a tower reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to heauen, that they might get them a name; but it was rightly called Babel, bringing in the end nothing but confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to them, and their proud building. <hi>Absolon</hi> whilest he desired to bee exalted into the throne, was hanged in a tree; <hi>Adoniah</hi> aspired to the crowne, but because God had not appointed it to be set on his head, he lost both it and his life too: yea our first parents themselues whilest they desired a state aboue the condition of men, and equall with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, they lost their present excellency and made themselues vassals and slaues to the wicked spirits. Others make some little progresse in their wished way to honour and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but yet neuer come to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> goale, nor obtain the garland, being either crossed in their course, or fainting for wearines, or tripped vp by those y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> come next after them, who as sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly fal, as rise, and no sooner make some glorious shew, but
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:10731:333"/> presently they are againe obscured; like vnto falling starres, which in the same instant appeare and vanish. And that either because they ambitiously hasten, and vnseasonablie aspire to these honors before their time, desiring to reape the fruit of glory &amp; preferment, before they haue sowne the seeds of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue &amp; true desert; wherby they expose themselues to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of many oppositions, euery one being ready to hate their pride and to enuie their preferment, and to vse all meanes to stop their course in this ouer great hast: in which they fitly resemble hastie fruits, which blooming before the ordinarie time, doe seldome come to maturitie and ripenesse, because either they are nipped with the frosts, or blowne off with the tempests. Or else because they aspite to greater preferments then is befitting their gifts, whereby they suddenly burst, because they swell themselues bigger then their skins will hold; and wanting true worth and good parts to support their greatnesse, they suddenly fall and come to ruine: like vnto those who will climbe higher then the bowes will hold them; or vnto such as being weake and feeble, doe take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them heauie burthens. Others desire honour and glory in the world, but yet neuer attaine vnto it whilest they liue, because presence is an enemie to fame; and therefore many whom the world scarce tooke notice of whilest it had them,<note place="margin">Praesentia ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mica famae.</note> are magnified and extolled when it hath lost them. In which respect honour is fitly called the shadow of vertue; for as the shadow sometime goeth before a man, sometime side by side, sometime followeth after him, and sometime doth not appeare at all, as when the sunne is set, or obscured with the clouds: so sometime a man is honourable and not vertuous, his glory and fame running before true desert; sometime it accompanieth vertue, and euen whilest a man liueth he hath deserued praise; sometime hee neuer heareth in the whole course of his life, that he hath done any thing worthie fame, and yet after his death he hath the praise of all; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the best deserts do neuer in this world come to light, but either being done in obscurity, or obscured through others enuie, or the meannesse of the agent; they for euer lie: hid, till at the day of iudgement the God of light doth open and
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:10731:333"/> discouer them. Now (as one saith) what is fame after death, but a good gale of wind after shipwracke? Or what good doth it a mā to haue spent his whole time in paineful labour, and in wel deseruing; when the vnthankful world in his life hath paid him with enuie and detraction, though it magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth him after his death, seeing hee hath not the sense, much lesse the comfort of his commendations.</p>

                  </note> and that most commonly when it is too late, yet it promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it seasonablie vnto all; and maketh them beleeue, that if they will but set their hearts vpon it, and ambitiously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, they shal surely attaine vnto it: where as in truth they who most swell with pride, and aspire vnto honours with all their indeauours, doe most commonly misse of it, and seeking for glory find disgrace; the world vsing their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the meanes of their deiection and abasement, which it promised should bee the meanes of their aduancement. Wherein as the world sheweth it trecherie and deceit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards those that faune vpon it; so also impotency and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiencie, in that it is vtterly vnable to aduance men to that glory and dignitie which it promiseth. For howsoeuer possiblie the world would be willing and forward enough to giue prioritie to his forward children, and to aduance those into the seate of honour, which make most suit, and take the greatest paines to rise; yet it cannot helpe and raise them as they would, because God crosseth them in their courses, and will not suffer them to aspire vnto their proud hopes, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they will rise of themselues without his helpe, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto the height of honour by their owne meanes, therefore hee meeteth them in the mid way, casting them downe againe, when they thinke themselues neerest to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement, and glorifying his owne power and iustice, in their ruine and vtter disgrace. And this is that which is often threatned against the proud and ambitious in the Scriptures. So the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> saith: <hi>The high looke of man shall be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi>

<pb n="596" facs="tcp:10731:335"/> the approbation of God, and testimonie of their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and do not ambitiously affect glorie and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. As for example, it is not ambitious <hi>Caesar,</hi> proud <hi>Pompey,</hi> nor <hi>Alexander,</hi> greater in his owne conceit, then in his conquests, that the world now magnifieth, because it plainly perceiueth that they aimed at this marke in all their actions, and made glorie the maine end of all their enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; but it is the contemned Prophets, poore fishermen, and despised carpenters Son (as they disdainfully termed the most glorious and eternall Sonne of God) whom it now praiseth and admireth; as plainly discerning that in all their good and vertuous actions, they sought not their owne glorie, but the glory of God, and the eternal good of mankind. By all which it appeareth that the way of attaining true honor, is not greedily to desire it, but worthily to deserue it, neither doth it alwaies happen vnto them who most desiring it, do also best deserue it; but rather vnto them who best deseruing it, do most auoid it. In which respect honor may fitly be compared to the meteor which is called <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> or the going-fire, which flieth the follower, and followeth the flier; or vnto a mans shadow, which can no otherwise be catched then by falling downe vpon it.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I shewed the great vncertainty of obtaining<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 8. The great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining worldly riches.</hi>
                  </note> worldly honors, although they be sought with all earnestnes. The like also may be said of riches; for howsoeuer many worldly men do wholly set their hearts vpon them, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue them with all their desires and endeauours, rising earely, and going late to bed, toiling and moiling, deceiuing &amp; cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumuenting, wronging and oppressing one another, yea de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding and pinching their backs and bellies, that they may compasse great estates, and gather riches in abundance; yet how few of these many do attaine vnto them? yea how many are there who making this Mammon of iniquity the idoll wherein they chiefly trust, do make vnto it many a weary pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, vndertaking painfull iorneyes, sustaining much pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury and misery, and hazarding themselues to innumerable dangers both by sea and land, and al to haue their idol fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and propitious; and yet are turned away with a frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:10731:335"/> countenance, and lose al their labour, ending their daies in want and pouerty? And whereas almost all men spend their whole time and trauell in finding out these rich mines, and saile to these golden Indies, for the multiplying of their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, yet how few find that they seeke? how many in their voyage running themselues on the rockes of aduerse acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, do make shipwracke of their whole estates? and how many hauing gotten that they sought, are robbed of all when they are returning, and thinke of nothing but of setling their estates, &amp; of spending the rest of their time in peace &amp; quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? So that it is not all a mans care and labour that can assure him of these vncertaine riches, as the Apostle calleth them;<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 9.</note> seeing many want them who haue sacrificed al their strength and endeuours vnto them; and some obtaine them with ease and moderate labour, al their great expences which seeme so much losse turning to their aduantage, and like seed, which though in outward shew it seemeth to be cast away, to rot and perish, yet it returneth a fruitful haruest of plenty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease. And this the Wise man obserued: <hi>There is</hi> (saith he)<note place="margin">Prou. 11. 24. 25.</note>
                  <hi>that scattereth and is more increased, but he that spareth more then is right shall surely come to pouertie. The liberall person shall haue plentie, and he that watereth shall haue raine.</hi> Yea the greater care and paine that a man taketh, and the more eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he hasteth to be rich, the further oftentimes he is from his desire, and the neerer to want and miserie. So the Wise man<note place="margin">Prou. 28. 22.</note> also saith, that <hi>with a wicked eye a man hasteth vnto riches, and knoweth not that pouerty shall come vpon him.</hi> And who obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not that many hauing gotten into their possession suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient store, if they could be content with that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and yet not being satisfied, do whilest they labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more, lose that they haue, and like the dog in the fable in greedy snatching after a shadow, forgo the substance? In which respect the world oftentimes abuseth and cozeneth men, like those who keep great lotteries; for whilest it incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth them by propounding hope of great and excessiue gaine, to hazard those small matters which already they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse, it deciueth them of all, there being an hundred blankes for one good prize, and therefore an hundred to one that he
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:10731:336"/> who ventreth, faileth of his desire, and that if he pursue his great, but yet foolish and ill grounded hopes, he will in the end bring his something to nothing, and in coueting that he hath not, lose that which he already hath. And yet so are mēs eies dazled, and their concupiscence set on fire with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious shew of some few rich booties, that though not one of a thousand can possibly haue them, yet euery one is possessed with a vaine hope, that he shall be the man who shall draw the rich lot, and cary away the costly prizes from all the rest.</p>
               <p>And thus also though men, like worldly epicures set their<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 9. Of the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning worldly pleasures.</hi>
                  </note> minds wholly vpon voluptuous pleasures, and more heartily affect, and earnestly seek these carnal delights, then those ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fading pleasures, and eternall ioyes in Gods kingdome, yet do they often faile of their desires, and howsoeuer like sweet singing birds, they allure &amp; inuite them with their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious harmony to come vnto them, yet no sooner do they approach to seaze vpon them, but presently they hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, or flie away; leauing their admirers and seekers in the thickets and bushes, where they oftentimes prick themselues in their pursuite, &amp; find nothing but thornes and briars which rent and scratch them, in stead of those sweet delights which inticed them vnto them. For how many are there who aboue al things desire to solace themselues with these worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and yet are forced, whether they wil or no, to spend the greatest part of their life in griefe and miserie? how many seeke to delight themselues with sports and pastimes, games and recreations, who being crossed in them, when as they do not succeed according to their desire, do find tormēt, in stead of pleasure, &amp; change all their mirth into fretting &amp; fuming, cursing &amp; swearing, as though because they can take no ioy in the pleasures of men, they would trie whether they could find it in the delights of the diuell, and (as I may say) in the exercises of hell? how many are there who seeking to please their dainty pallet, with delicate drinks, and curious cooked meats, take a surfet, &amp; drinke their bane greedily like a sweet poison, falling into dangerous diseases, which often bring with them vntimely death? how many seeking their chiefe delight in the pleasures of the flesh, doe thereby waste their
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:10731:336"/> strength, consume their bodies, and receiuing contagious infection, cast themselues into many desperate and entolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diseases, no lesse shamefull then full of torment?</p>
               <p>And therefore seeing wee may spend all our liues and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 10. That we may be assured to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine spirituall graces and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly ioyes, if we truely seeke them.</hi>
                  </note> in seeking these worldly things, and yet neuer find them, nor attaine vnto our earthly ends, after wee haue with our whole indeauours sought to compasse them; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding (as before I haue shewed) are so vaine, worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and vnprofitable, that though they might bee gotten with case, yet they were scarce worthie our labour; let vs not set our hearts vpon these vncertaine vanities, which if wee should obtaine, neuer come vnaccompanied with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine miseries: but rather affect and desire Gods sanctifying and sauing graces, and the eternal ioyes of Gods kingdome, which if we truely seeke, wee shall surely find, and bee at no hazard at all of losing our labour. And this argument of not spending our paines in vaine, the Apostle vseth to encourage the Corinthians in the constant profession and practise of Christianity. <hi>Therefore my beloued brethren</hi> (saith he) <hi>bee yee</hi>

And besides he hath free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound himselfe by his gracious promises, confirmed with his oath and seales, that if we <note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 1. 53. Esa. 55. 1. 2.</note> hunger after his spirituall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he will surely satisfie vs; if we <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 7. 7.</note> seeke them, we shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly find them; and if feeling our wants wee doe but beg them at his hands, in the <note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 16. 23.</note> name of Iesus Christ, hee will without faile giue them vnto vs. Neither is there lesse cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the other, to those who seeke for that eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse;<note place="margin">That there are heauenly ioyes prepared for Gods seruants.</note> for first, that there is that euerlasting ioy, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly glory prepared for Gods Saints and seruants, it may be
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:10731:337"/> proued by diuers arguments; for it is written in the hearts of men by the finger of God, and reuealed by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that after this life there are ioyes prepared for the good and vertuous, and punishments for the wicked and vicious, which euen while we continue in the world, refresheth the one with comfort in all their miseries, and affrighteth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with terrours and feares, in all their pleasures and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. Againe, the immortality of the soule being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by both diuine and heathen writers, it followeth hereupon that there is also an euerlasting life, wherein it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortally liueth, either in ioy or miserie. Furthermore there is a naturall desire imprinted in mans heart and mind, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy his happinesse and chiefe good, which neuer any man atta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ned vnto in this life, and therefore most certainely it is reserued for those who seeke it in the life to come. Or else this naturall desire should be in vaine, as neuer attaining vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it end. Finally, if we know that there is a God, then must we also acknowledge that he is iust, as being the chief Iudge of heauen and earth; and consequently that he administreth righteous iudgement, rewarding the godly and vertuous, and punishing the wicked and euill doers; but this hee doth not doe in this life, seeing for the most part, heere the wicked flourish, and the righteous are afflicted; and therefore these rewards and punishments are chiefly reserued for the life to come. And this argument the Apostle vseth: <hi>If</hi> (saith he) <hi>in this life onely we haue hope in Christ, we are of all men most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 19.</note> from whence wee may assume, that it will not stand with Gods iustice, that those who faithfully serue him, should be more miserable, then they who oppose and rebell against him; and therefore of necessity it followeth, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life they who feare and serue the Lord haue better hopes, and more rich rewards reserued for them. Vnto these reasons we may adde those testimonies of truth it selfe, which can neuer deceiue or faile. The Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> saith, that <hi>those who sleep in the dust shall awake, some to euerlasting life, and</hi>

                  <hi>promises, not onely of this life, but also of the life to come.</hi> All which promises being apprehended by a true &amp; liuely faith, do certainly assure vs that we shal be inheritours of this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happinesse: for hee <hi>is faithfull that hath promised, and his</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note>
                  <hi>him; &amp; that whilest he liued in the flesh, he liued by the faith in the sonne of God.</hi> And whosoeuer haue this life eternall begun in them, they may certainely be assured, that it shall be perfited and accomplished vnto them, and hauing begun it in the life of grace, that they shal finish it in that euerlasting life of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: whereas contrariwise, those shall neuer liue in that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> happinesse eternally, who haue not in this world made an entrance into it, by liuing this life of faith and grace. Now vnto this certainty let vs adde also the facility of obtaining;

Psalme 119. 14. 32. 130.</note> this narrow passage; but if we lay aside the old man, with the grosse corruptions thereof, and become spirituall and holy in our minds, affections &amp; actions, we shall haue roome enough to enter. Againe, this difficulty and straitnes is only at the first sight whē we behold this way a far off, without any desire to go into it; whereas if we come neerer hand, with a full reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to enter into this narrow passage, we shal find it open, easie and large enough; euen as when being in a broad way, and looking farre before vs vpon a narrow lane, we thinke it quite closed vp, and are ready (if experience helped vs not more then sight) to turne backe, as being hopelesse in finding any passage; but when we still go forward and come neere vnto the place, we find an easie entrance for foure or fiue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which we supposed was not large enough for one: so although the way to heauen seemeth strait to those who look vpon it with carnall eyes, yet this is not so much in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rownes of the passage it selfe, as in the error of our sight; for they who approach vnto it find an open passage, and being once entred, do trauell forward with great delight.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd thus haue I shewed that these worldly things<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 1. That the world is corruptible, and shall end.</hi>
                  </note> are not much to be esteemed or desired, yea to be contemned and despised, in comparison of Gods spiritual graces and heauenly ioyes, in regard that they are most vncertaine in obtaining, though we should set our harts vpon them, &amp; pursue them with al our endeauours, and these most certaine and assured, to all that loue and seeke them. Now let vs further consider, that if by our great care and labour we do obtaine them, the possession is no lesse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine then the suite. And that both in respect of the things themselues, &amp; also in respect of vs, who are possessed of them. For first, al worldly things are most vncertaine when they are possessed, because they are momentany &amp; mutable: momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany in regard of themselues, as being in their owne nature corruptible, &amp; subiect to dissolution; and mutable in regard of vs; as being changeable, &amp; subiect to alteration. In respect also of vs they are vncertaine, because we are mortall, &amp; our liues momentanie; and therefore though they should not be taken from vs, yet we cannot long cōtinue together, because we shall in short time be taken from them. Concerning the momentany continuance of these worldly things, it may eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare, if we consider that the whole world it selfe generally, and specially all that is contained in it, are but of
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:10731:339"/> short continuance, and subiect to corruption; for such as are all the parts of the world, such also is the whole; but experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth, that all the parts of the world are subiect to corruption and dissolution, and consequently this whole vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse cannot be incorruptible and eternall; but shal in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time be dissolued and come to ruine: and this the Scriptures also plainly teach vs, that as the world had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning;<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 11.</note> so also it must haue an ending. To this purpose the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, that <hi>the world passeth away, &amp; the lusts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;</hi>

                  </note> such a rotten foundation, as cannot possibly long stand, and may for ought we know presently fall? who would build his house in such a citie as he certainly knew would within a while be consumed with fire, being vncertaine in what part of this short time, it would come to this expected ruine? what wise man will build his house vpon the sincking sands, where it is either ready to sincke with them, or to be beaten downe at the next high flood, and not rather vpon the firme rocke, where it shall remaine vnmoueable? But the Scriptures teach

But the Lord our God the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full builder of this great frame of heauen and earth, whose cunning cannot be deceiued, nor truth deceiue, hath plainly told vs that this great building shall within short time fall; and therefore who would heere seat his hopes? who would not change his dwelling, especially seeing we are proffered the fee-simple of that goodly building not made with hands, but eternall in the heauens? yea we are assured of the worlds<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 1.</note> approching ruine, not only by the word of God, but euen also by our owne experience; for we our selues do see it rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennes, we daily behold how the strength thereof decayeth, and that all the creatures do wax more feeble, being much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in their naturall powers and vertues, and shewing by their weaknes and sicknes that they approch neere their end: the heauens haue not that vertue in their influences as in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times; the heate of the Sunne is much abated, and his vitall operation in sublunarie and terrestriall bodies greatly weakened, and though (as the learned haue obserued) this life-giuing fire be lower and neerer vnto vs, yet his vertue being decayed, we haue lesse comfort and feeling of his heat. The earth also which is the mother and nurse of all inferiour creatures, being come to old age, and wearie and spent with
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:10731:340"/> much bearing, hath not her ancient vertue and vigour in bringing forth her fruits for the vse and nourishment of man; by reason whereof he is much lessened in growth, enfeebled in strength, and obnoxious to many more infirmities and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases then were his ancestors. All which shew that the world is in it old and decrepit age, and not farre from death. For as in the little world of man, so also in this greater world and large vniuerse, there is a time of youth, and full strength, and a time of old age, and decrepit weaknesse; a time of life, and a time of death. And as man in his youth is lustie and strong, hauing his bones full of marrow, and his sinowes of strength; his skinne full of flesh, his whole body full of naturall heate and moisture, and quickened with vitall spirits: but when age commeth, his strength is abated, his backe crooked, his spirits spent, and all parts so full of infirmities and weaknes, that they are not able to performe their naturall functions and actions, till at last the limbes being altogether vnable to support the staggering bodie, it stumbleth and falleth at the threshold of death: so the world had it time of youth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it flourished in beautie, health, and strength, and was able to propagate a posterity like it selfe, and to nourish and make it fat with all delights; but now it is come to old age, wherein all the powers thereof are so weakened and enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that it cannot bee but the death thereof neere appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth; and therefore let vs not set our hearts vpon that which is ready to vanish; let vs not now foolishly dote vpon the world in it withered old age, wherein it hath lost all it beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">

                  </note> more are al the things therin contained, especially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider them in our vse and fruition; for whereas all things in the world are past, present, or to come; that which is past is perished, and as though it were not; that which is to come, is vncertaine, hauing not yet his being; and therefore we can truely be said onely to enioy the present, which is momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ready to vanish. In respect of which momentany con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of worldly things, they may fitly bee compared to fierie meteors, which make for the instant a glorious shew, but are inflamed and extinguished in the same moment; to the vncertaine winds, which suddenly blow, and suddenly cease; to deceitfull dreames, which bring a seeming short pleasure, but vanish when one awaketh; and to the houses, castles, and characters which children in their play doe make in the sands, which either are ouerthrowne and defaced with euery blast of wind, or washed away with the next tide. The<note place="margin">Nazianz. de pauperum amore.</note> author of the booke of Wisedome likeneth the riches, pompe and glory of the world, to the passing away of a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or post, and to the passage of a ship which glideth ouer the waues, and being gone by, leaueth no trace or path be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it in the flouds, or to a bird that flieth in the aire, and no man seeth any token of her passage, or finally to an arrow<note place="margin">Wisd. 5. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12.</note> shot at a marke, and parting the aire, which immediately commeth together againe, so that no man can know where it went thorow. Another demanding what humane things<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Hebraeos 6.

And in truth who seeth not that these worldly things do flow and reflow like the sea, there following presently after a full tide of pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, a low ebbe of aduersitie; after a bright day of ioy▪ a darke night of sorrow; after faire weather, and a pleasing calme of comfort, a blustering storme, and turbulent tempest of crosses and afflictions, after a bright full of mirth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, the darke waine of sorrow and discontentment; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

And yet there were some indifferencie if these worldly things were as soone gotten as lost, and that our estate were as quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired as it is ruined; but contrariwise experience teacheth vs, that the ascent to the obtaining our worldly desires is by little and little, and the descent headlong; that we are long in gathering that which is in a moment scattered, and lose that in an houre, which with great care and incessant labour, we haue hardly attained vnto in our whole liues.</p>

In respect whereof when this day of parting commeth, a man would willingly desire, that his comforts and delights in those things which he formerly affected had been lesse, that now also he might haue lesse sorrow. Whereby it appeareth that there can be no great happinesse in any thing which is but of momentany continuance, and that nothing is much to be desired which is mortall and must end: because when the time is once past, though it haue been neuer so long, it will appeare to those who looke backe vpon it, but as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the greater ioy it hath brought in the fruition, the the greater griefe wil it also bring, because at last they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of it.

The reason hereof is, because the more highly men are aduanced, the greater commonly is their pride; and the more full they are of the wind of vaine-glory, the neerer they are to bursting; because the Lord opposing against the proud man aboue all other sinners, by reason of all others he most opposeth against him, doth cast him suddenly downe, and bringeth him to nought, when he is most secure, and stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth strongest, and out of danger of falling in his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.

               <p>Finally, as worldly honors and riches, so also worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 10. That worldly pleasures are short and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany.</hi>
                  </note> and delights are short and momentanie; like vnto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull dreames, which please for the present, but vanish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way when one awaketh: for when men with great paines and labour haue procured for themselues these worldly pleasures, they are readie to forsake them, as soone as they salute them, and to end in their fruition, dying (as it were) in the verie birth. Thus do the pleasures of eating and drinking present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanish, as soone as the meat and drinke is swallowed into the stomacke; thus sports and pastimes are inioyed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the same moment; thus sweet musicke delighteth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whilest it is in hearing, the pleasure and sound at once lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs; and finally, thus goodly maskes and shewes, giue only delight whilest they are looked vpon, and like appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons no sooner appeare, then vanish. In a word, though we should enioy all worldly delights euen our whole life, some few daies excepted, all that are passed would not minister a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny comfort, to cheare and vphold vs in this short time of their absence, and so is all the ioy of pleasures tied to their presence, that though we should enioy them the age of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuselah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ecclesiasticus 11. 27.</note> one houres aduersitie would make them all to be forgotten, vnlesse they be called to mind, as argumēts to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauate our present vnhappines, because now when we need most comfort, we are forsaken of all our former delights. And this momentanie continuance of pleasures, is by <hi>Zophar</hi> plainly expressed, where he obserueth, <hi>that of old, and euer</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 20. 4. 5.</note>
                  <hi>since God placed man vpon the earth, the reioycing of the wicked hath been short, and that the ioy of hypocrites hath lasted but for a moment.</hi> And the Wise man familiarly explaineth it, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring these worldly delights to the noise of thornes vnder the pot, which howsoeuer for the instant they make a great crackling, and a glorious blaze, yet euery one knoweth, that<note place="margin">Eccles. 7. 8.</note> as they are suddenly kindled, so also they are as suddenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished; for howsoeuer they delight for the instant, yet
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:10731:348"/> they perish in the very tasting, and passe away as soone as they are come, leauing behind them nothing but griefe and sorrow, either because they were at all enioyed, or are so soone departed. So another doth most liuely expresse y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> short tarriance of these worldly pleasures, by comparing them to letters written in the waters, which in the same moment are<note place="margin">Gregor. Nys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen. in Eccles. Hom. 5.</note> made and defaced, no print or impression of them being left behind: for as in that, the paine is no lesse, then if a man did write in lasting parchment, but the continuance of the letters written no longer then they are in making, so there goeth as great paine to the obtaining of these worldly delights, as of those which are heauenly and eternall, and yet the fruition lasteth no longer then the very act and operation, and being once past, no print or impression of them remaineth after them. And therefore seeing these▪ worldly pleasures are so momentanie, and of short continuance; let vs not set our hearts vpon them, but rather affect and seeke for those which are spirituall and heauenly; for if we delight our selues in the<note place="margin">Iohn 16. 22.</note> Lord, and in the fruition of his mercies, vouchsafed vnto vs in his Sonne Christ, our Sauiour himselfe hath assured vs, that this ioy shall euer last, and no man shall be able to take it from vs; and the Psalmist telleth vs that those heauenly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures<note place="margin">Psalme 16. 11.</note> which are at Gods right hand, endure for euermore. Especially let vs take heed that we do not compasse vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pleasures, or by vnlawfull meanes, or immoderately loue those which in themselues are lawfull; for what folly and madnes were it, to hazard by sin the losse of much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent pleasures which are eternall, for the fruition of these<note place="margin">Psalme 92. 6. 7.</note> which are no lesse vaine then momentanie? yea to indanger our soules to euerlasting torments, for the present enioying of these fading delights?</p>

                  </note> the world are momentany and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Now we are also briefly to shew, that as they are momentany in themselues, so they are mutable and vnconstant in respect of vs. For though they bee but of short continuance, yet if they were friends for life, and would not forsake vs till either they perished, or we died, they might bee thought more worthie our loue, if not for their vtility and profit, yet at least for their fidelity and constancie; whereas now they are not so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany as they are mutable, being ready to leaue and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake vs euery day of their short continuance, like fickle flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, of whose fauour and loue there can bee no certainty or assurance. And no maruell that these earthly things vpon which men dote are so subiect to change, seeing all things in the world are obnoxious to mutability: the heauens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues are not free from alterations; the sunne and moone haue their eclipses; the times varie and change one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the day with night, and night with day; winter with summer, and summer with winter, and neuer stand at a stay; the elements haue continually their transmutations one with another, and by maintaining continuall warre among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, procure a peacefull harmonie, and well agreeing tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature in sublunarie and inferiour bodies, vntill one of them hath vanquished and ouercome all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The elements are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to continuall change, and we are partakers with them in their alterations: and when in the conflict which they hold in our bodies the naturall fire hath deuoured, and as it were conquered the airie water, it selfe also hauing no other food but it enemies prouision, is ouercome in conquering, and we with them both doe fall in the battell, and die of their wounds. And finally, there can be no change in States, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:10731:349"/> and cities, where we inhabit, but wee likewise haue a share in their alterations, laughing in their mirth, and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in their mourning. No maruell therefore if the estate of man be changeable, seeing he hath a great part in the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all other creatures, and besides hath in himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable internall causes of variable mutation. In regard<note place="margin">Senec. epist. 59</note> whereof one saith, that none of vs are the same in our age that we were in our youth; no man is the same to day that he was yesterday▪ but our bodies are caried in a continuall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, like vnto riuers, and all we looke vpon doth run away with time, nothing remaining the same to morrow as wee now see it; yea euen I (saith hee) whilest I speake of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, am my selfe changed. Neither are our bodies more mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table then our estates, which through the whole course of our liues are daily subiect to alterations, and nothing conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth firme and permanent in them, but as the traueller is sometimes on the high hils, and sometime in the low val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leies, and sometime walking on euen ground: so wee in our pilgrimage are one while aloft in the mountaines of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and soone after in the low dales of aduersity, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a meane and euen condition betweene both; or like vnto those that are sailing on the sea, who are one while lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as it were to the clouds, and in an instant buried in the deepe; one while becalmed so as they cannot goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and by and by hurried with a boisterous tempest; now in danger of rushing one against another, and soone after of dashing against a rocke; sometimes suffring shipwracke, and alwaies fearing it; neither are they euer secure, and at rest, till they be arriued in the hauen: for so in this life wee are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time aduanced, and sometime abased, one while sluggish with too much prosperity, so as we cannot moue in any good and christian courses, and another while tossed and turmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the blustring stormes of aduersity, whereby though we make a more speedy progresse, yet not without many troubles, and much danger.

Yea euen those things in the world which chiefly intitle prosperity, are most variable and subiect to change, and like vnto the dust raised by the wind, they are tossed to and fro, and from one to another, as it pleaseth Gods prouidence to dispose of them; or vnto shadowes and apparitions, which vanish away and slip betweene the hands, when a man thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to take surest hold.

                  </note> in the speciall instances. And first, what can be more vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and variable then honors and preferments? seeing those who are thus aduanced, do continually walk in slipperie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where they are still ready to catch a fall; and borrowing their glory in a great part from the vnconstant opinion of the sickle multitude, which like the weathercocke turneth with euery wind, their fame and reputation must needs be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding variable, resting it selfe vpon such an vnstable ground.<note place="margin">Plin. lib. 2. cap. 99.</note> In which regard worldly men are fitly compared to shelfish, which depending vpon the Moone, are subiect to al her chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, encreasing as she encreaseth, and decreasing, as she incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth towards the waine; for so their honor standing at the deuotion of the vncōstant multitude, altereth and changeth, riseth and falleth, according to the ful or waine of their varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conceits. The world promiseth indeed perpetuitie of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors to those who will set their hearts vpon them, and prefer them before the glory of God, and the saluation of their own soules, but he dealeth sometime vnfaithfully with his fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, treacherously betraying them vnder shew of loue, and
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:10731:351"/> lifting them vp, whom he meaneth to ouerthrow with the greatest downefall: wherin the world and the Prince thereof, vse ambitious men as the crow the shel-fish, carying them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft vnto the highest places, that from thence casting them downe, they may bruise them with the fall, and so more easily prey vpon thē. But as they deale thus with their own friends, sometime because they will not, and sometime because they cannot prefer them; so much more falsly and vnconstantly with those who neglect and contemne their deceitfull ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, being readie to magnifie and disgrace them with the same breath, when as they cannot allure them to bite at their bewitching baits. An example whereof we haue in <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> whom the vulgar people (admiring their miracle)<note place="margin">Act. 14. 11. 14. 19.</note> would needs deifie; which honor whē they had refused, and perswaded them to returne all the glorie vnto God, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently vpon a groundlesse information, laid violent hands vpon them and stoned them, now thinking that they deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued capitall punishments, whom ere-while they esteemed worthie diuine honor.

But most notablie doth the mutabilitie, and fickle vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancie of the variable multitude appeare in their cariage towards our Sauiour Christ; whom one day they sought after<note place="margin">Matth. 21. 8. 9. with cap. 27. 22.</note> to make him a King; and soone after reiecting him, preferred before him an Heathen, yea a hated Monarch: one while they flocked about him, to giue him all louing and respectiue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, strawing greene boughes in his way, and (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they thought them not good enough) spreading also their garments, euen vnder his Asses feet; and another while mocking and reuiling him, buffetting and spitting vpon him, whipping and crucifying him, &amp; in stead of bestowing their garments vpon him, they take from him his owne: this day they meet him with ioy, and salute him, saying, <hi>Hosanna the Sonne of Dauid, blessed be he that commeth in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest;</hi> but within a few daies after they crie out with an vniuersall consent, <hi>Away with him, away with him: crucifie him, crucifie him.</hi> Which as it notablie▪ sheweth
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:10731:351"/> the mutabilitie of honors, and the vnconstancie of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, so also the malice of Satan, who would (as one<note place="margin">Bernard. in Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis Palmarum Serm. 2.</note> saith) haue his procession go immediatly before his passion, these honors, before those disgraces, and this high exaltation before his lowest downefall, that by this sudden alteration he might be the lesse prouided, &amp; his passion made more bitter and intollerable: although the Lord who disposed of all had<note place="margin">Matth. 21. 5.</note> another end, namely, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quoniam subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miora grauius corruunt, gaudet princeps super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biae, cos quos po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuerit sua im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsione proster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere, adcelsiora creuisse.</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bros. in Psal. 48. §. <hi>Sect. 4.

               <p>But in truth howsoeuer this vnconstancie of honors may be attributed to the mutabilitie and treacherie of the world, and the Prince thereof, in regard that they promise it to their followers, and faile in performance; &amp; as they are made y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of God, both in the conferring and taking away of honors; wherein they take occasion to shew their fawning in the one, and their malice in the other; yet the supreame and chiefe cause of these alterations in honors and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is the wise prouidence of almightie God, who would haue these worldly honors variable and vnconstant, chiefely for his owne childrens sake, both for their triall and chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and because he would not haue them to set their harts too much vpon them, and so neglect that eternal glory of his heauenly kingdome; and secondarily for the iust punishment of the wicked, from whom he taketh away these honors af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath aduanced them, because they abuse them to pride<note place="margin">Iud. 1. 7.</note> and tyrannie. And thus <hi>Adonibezek</hi> of a great conquerer of Kings, became worse then a slaue, and equall to a dog, eating the offals vnder the table; wherein the Lord measured iustly vnto him, according to that measure by which he had meted vnto others. Thus <hi>Haman</hi> was one day the chiefe fauourite<note place="margin">Hester 3. 1. with chap. 7. 8. 10.</note> in court, and the next day hanged on his owne gallowes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee had abused his greatnesse to the ruine of Gods Church: and thus Gods owne Church and people after they
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:10731:352"/> had receiued many testimonies of his loue, and were by him exalted aboue all other nations; for abusing of these speciall fauours, were deiected and brought vnto a base condition: for so the Prophet complaineth; <hi>Ierusalem hath grieuously sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>

                  <hi>therefore she is in derision; all that honored her, despise her, because they haue seene her filthines.</hi> No maruell therefore if the world be vnconstant in conserting these honors, seeing in truth it hath no power to continue them, more then that which it receiueth from God, who as he is the chiefe Author of these honors, so he giueth and taketh them away at his owne pleasure.

                  <note place="margin">Psalme 73 18.</note> But whether we consider the chiefe or instrumentall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of this vnconstancie, sure we are that honors are most mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and flitting, vncertaine to winter where they haue sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered, or to lodge where they haue rested all day. And this mutable inconstancie the Wise man obserued; <hi>I haue</hi> (saith<note place="margin">Eccles. 10. 7.</note> he) <hi>seene seruants on horses, and Princes as seruants walking on the ground.</hi> To which purpose also the Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that <hi>many mighty men haue been brought to dishonor, and</hi>

                  <hi>the honorable haue been deliuered into other mens hands.</hi> The which mutability commonly happeneth when men are most secure, and are puffed vp in pride, in regard that they assure themselues of the constant continuance of their honors and preferments; their proudest hopes yeelding nothing vnto them but shame and disgrace. For so the Wise man saith, that <hi>pride goeth before destruction; and an high mind before the fall:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 16. 18. and 18. 12. and 11. 2.</note> and againe, <hi>when pride commeth, then commeth shame, but with the lowly is wisdome.</hi> And therefore seeing these worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors are so mutable and vnconstant, so hardly gotten &amp; easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lost, let vs not too much esteeme them, nor immoderately loue and seeke them, but rather let vs set our hearts vpon sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wisdome and true godlines; for as the Wise man saith,

                  </note> though our riches corrupt not, nor wee die, yet there is no certainty in their possession, they are so flitting and mutable.

Looke but to houses, lands, and coine, and consider how often they haue new owners, this day being in the possession of one, and to morrow of another, and not many moneths after, both being stripped of them, they are deuolued vnto a third. In which respect <hi>Zophar</hi> compareth riches to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of riuers, which make no long stay in any place, and passe from land to land, and field to field, till at last they are swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp of the sea. <hi>The increase</hi> (saith he) <hi>of his▪ house shall</hi>

In the same regard one of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents<note place="margin">Origen. in Mat. 6. 16.

And to the same purpose another saith; that there is nothing more false and trecherous then riches; and that like a fugitiue and vngratefull seruant, they haue no honesty or fidelitie; for though thou bind them with innumerable bonds, they will goe away, and draw their<note place="margin">Chrysost. ad pop.

The which inconstancie and mutabilitie of riches, as it proceedeth instrumentally from the world, who is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant in it fauours, aduancing those to wealth whom soone after it is ready to impouerish; so chiefly and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally from the Lord, who in his gracious prouidence made earthly riches mutable, because we should not fix our hearts vpon such vnchangeable vanities, but vpon those heauenly treasures which are immutable, and not subiect to any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and that seeing euery day they are ready to leaue vs whether we will or no, wee might bee the rather willing to part with them to such good and charitable vses, as may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, and further ascertaine vs of our eternall treasures. Whereas if hee had made them immutable and permanent, whom would they not haue bewitched with their loue? For if now men hauing no security or assurance, to keepe them in their possession but one onely day, doe notwithstanding dote so much in their loue, that by right and wrong they lay violent hands vpon them, and wring them vniustly out of others custodie, hazarding euen their soules to increase their wealth; what would they haue done if they had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and faithfull friends, that do all this, they being treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and deceitfull flatterers? What widow would they not haue robbed? what orphane would they not haue spoiled? what weake &amp; poore man would they not haue oppressed, to<note place="margin">Chrysost. ad pop. Antioch.

To conclude, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these riches of the world are so mutable &amp; vnconstāt, let vs not set our hearts vpon them; and (as one saith) let vs not run a madding after these false fugitiues; for there is nothing more deceitfull, nothing more perfidious.

               <p>Finally, there is no more constancie or lesse mutability in<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. That worldly pleasures are vnconstant, and subiect to change.</hi>
                  </note> worldly pleasures; for though there be alwaies worldly men and worldly delights, yet are they neuer ascertained the one to the other; but as men change their pleasures, so pleasures change men, and euery hand while leauing the old, they are ready to betake them to new masters. Some waite not so much vpon men themselues, as vpon their age: as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, some attend vpon infancy, and leaue them in their youth; some delight them in their youth, and forsake them when they come to full maturity, and some accompanie them in their full strength, and will by no meanes stay the approch of old age. Others are tied to seuerall times of the yeere, as to spring, autumne, summer, winter, and bring great delight when they are vsed in their season; but failing herein they change their nature, and become irksome and tedious. And as for those pleasures which are vsuall and daily, delighting all persons, and at all times, we see vnto what common mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they are subiect, lasting no longer but for the present, and then degenerating into tedious molestations and cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some burthens. Thus meates and drinkes delight for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, but after surcharging the stomacke, they recompence an houres pleasure, with a whole daies paine. And thus plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the flesh are but of momentanie continuance, and suddenly impaire the strength, and bring the body to many infirmities, and much weakenesse. Besides which losse of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall delights, how many do we daily see, who abounding in all maner of sensuall pleasures, are soone after abandoned of them all, and spend the remainder of their daies in misery and mourning? and though they remaine in their iudgement and affection epicures still, making their bellie their god, and the world their paradise, yet find their idol whom they serue, so auerse towards them, that of necessity, whether they will or no, they are robbed of all pleasures, and passe their time
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:10731:354"/> in griefe, and sharpe affliction? And thus it appeareth that all these worldly things which men so fondly affect, are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table<note place="margin">

For what is this mutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but a certaine kind of mortality, seeing though they die not in themselues, yet they die vnto vs? yea in truth what is the continuance of these worldly things, but a kind of vnob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued corruptibility? for whilest any thing passeth from the present to the time to come, that which is past dieth and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth, God onely is immutable, because nothing past ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth from him; nothing to come addeth to him, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer was, is, or shall be, is with him all present.

For we are continually sailing towards the hauen of death, and we neuer want the wind of winged time to set vs forward; sometime in the way we perish by the leakes of our own intemperance, sometimes we split our selues vpon the rockes of dangers, or vpon the sands of carelesse securitie; sometime we are cast ouer boord by pirats and enemies, &amp; sometime carying all our loftie and proud sailes, we are ouerset and sunke with the boysterous blasts of aduerse accidents; &amp; though we scape all these dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers we shall not be long in comming to our hauen of rest; seeing we are neuer becalmed nor stand still, but night &amp; day go forward with a prosperous wind. It is true that the world, yea our owne deceitfull hearts, do promise vnto vs long life, yea dreame of a kind of eternitie which hath neuer end; for there is scarce any so old who thinketh not to liue a day lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and when that is spent, another day after that, &amp; so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth day after day in the same mind, and by consequence frameth to his hopes an imaginary perpetuitie; eternitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing else but a constant continuance of time without any ending.

                  </note> cause of impenitencie, and of the committing and liuing in all maner of sinne, so especially of the loue of the world, and worldly vanities: for because men thinke to continue long with them, they accordingly esteeme and set their hearts vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; whereas if they beleeued and remembred that not only the things which they so affect are momentany and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but also that they themselues are mortall, and of small continuance vpon the earth, and that euen this short time is most vncertaine; they would neuer preferre these transitorie trifles before their eternall patrimonie. And therefore seeing it is a forcible argument to moue all men to the contempt of the world and worldly vanities, because our liues are so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany and fraile, for though they were neuer so constant and permanent, yet we cannot long enioy them, seeing we are mortall, and of short abode on earth; let vs a little further consider of this point; and shew the momentanie shortnes of mans life both by testimonies of Scripture; and also by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and reason.

                  </note> mans life, the frailty and vncertainty of it, whereby we haue no assurance to enioy it so much as a minute of this short time, the vanity thereof would more euidently appeare. And of this wee need no other proofe but our owne experience, which daily teacheth vs, that as men haue but a short passage from the birth, to the vtmost confines of an aged life; so they seldome goe thorow to their iourneyes end, but are cut off in all times of this short way, with vnexpected accidents. In which respect the life of man may fitly be compared to a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, which whilest it shineth, consumeth; and as the candle is sometime wasted with the wind, sometime quite blowne out, before it bee halfe burned, and sometime burneth to the end: so mans life is wasted with griefes and miseries, sometime extinguished by immature or violent death; and though it last as long as the naturall heate hath moisture to feed vpon, yet that being consumed, like a candle it goeth out of it selfe for want of nourishment. For how many haue we knowne in our owne experience who haue bin intombed in their mothers bellie, before they did euer see the light of the sun, and so withered in the bud? How many do we daily see, who seeme to enter into the world (as the heathen man vpon the stage) that they may go out againe; as though they came onely to take their leaue, and so to be gone? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wither when they are in their flourishing prime of their infancie and childhood, and (as it were) rot before they bee ripe? How many are taken away in their perfect maturity, death getting the victorie of them in their full strength? and how few are they that attaine vnto old age, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all doe hope for, though against all reason in regard of themselues, and experience in respect of others? For would men consider the manifold ambushments, which death daily laieth to indanger our liues; would they but remember how many by-paths leade to this common way, they could not but confesse the shortnesse of mans life, and their vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:10731:357"/> to continue this short time. For I pray you how many, yea how innumerable be the causes which produce this one ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, some whereof are internall, and some externall? For suppose that we were exempted from all outward dangers, which notwithstanding doe in whole troups besiege mans life, yet wee continually carrie death in our owne bosoms. For looke how many kinds of diseases there are whereunto mans life is subiect, and so many secret enemies doe wee har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in our selues, which fight against our liues, and giue death an easie entrāce. We are not too cold, or too hot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger; hunger and excesse are alike pernicious, seruing both as harbingers to prouide death a lodging in our hearts; yea euery small crumbe going awrie, maketh a breach wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by death may enter and surprise vs. So that wee cannot saue our liues by fighting, because wee nourish so many in vs which are daily ready to betray vs; nor escape by flight, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we could flee from our selues, seeing whether we wil or no, we continually carrie the enemies of our liues about vs, yea within vs.</p>
               <p>But let it be supposed that there were peace at home; let vs<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 5. Of the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable dangers vnto which mans life is daily subiect.</hi>

For to say nothing of common calamities, which hang ouer whole common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, as famine, sword, and pestilence, which are Gods publicke heralds to denounce against vs war and destruction, how many priuie waies are there whereby death commeth vnto vs, yea we vnto death? For which way can we turne vs, what action or enterprise can we take in hand, but that there is some danger, that death wil encounter vs? If we take ship, we are but a few inches distant from death, the immoueable rockes, and the mutable winds, the ouerflowing waues, and swallowing sands, the tempestuons stormes, and spoiling py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats haue our liues at their mercy &amp; command. If we stay on the land, we are daily obnoxious to no fewer perils; if wee take horse, our liues are in danger euery time he stumbleth; if we go in the streets, looke how many carts and coches we meet,
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:10731:357"/> yea how many tiles be on the eaues of houses which wee passe vnder, and to so many dangers are we subiect. If wee walke in the countrie, we are in hazard to be incountered with brutish creatures, and with theeues and robbers more cruell then they.

If we rest in our houses in the night, we are in perill of cutthrotes and robbers; or though we were safe from theeues, yet we are in danger of all deuouring fire. If we walke abrode in the day, euery one that hateth vs hath our liues at his command; and as one saith, whosoeuer contemneth his owne life, is master of ours. In a word, be we on sea or land, in citie or countrie, at home or abrode, waking or sleeping; death still like a iaylor waiteth vpon vs, till he bee commanded by the Lord chiefe Iustice of heauen and earth, to arrest, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and bring vs to iudgement. Now if any will obiect, that there are many which escape the forenamed dangers, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through them all vnhurt and vntouched, do safely come to old age and naturall death: I answere, that many more doe fall into them; and why may not wee thinke to bee in the greater number? many escape them, but all are subiect vnto them; and that which is incident to all, may happen vnto any: finally, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny escape some of these perils, but yet fall into others, and though to day they are free from them all, yet to morrow they may be obnoxious to many. By all which it appeareth, that our liues are not only in themselues momentany, but also in respect of outward accidents, and inward infirmities, vncertaine, and full of frailty; in regard whereof the Apostle calleth our bodies<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 1.</note> earthly houses, which wanting solid matter, and strong princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals to support them, are easily ouerthrowne, or of themselues in short time moulder away; and in the same place hee calleth them tabernacles, which stand not long any where, but are still flitting and remouing. And another maketh them much more fraile and brittle then glasses, which though they be subiect to many casualties, yet may they outlast the longest liuer. What (saith he) is more brittle then a glasse? and yet it may bee so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued,<note place="margin">August.

As when two botes meet, they which are in the one imagine that themselues moue not; and the other that passeth by them goeth swiftly; whereas in truth

But such is mans life, from which so much is detracted, as is added vnto it, and the longer it hath lasted, the more it is wasted, and the neerer it approcheth to it end. Now what can be called long, which by it continuing and being, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth and ceaseth to be? or how can our daies be many, which grow fewer &amp; fewer by daily multiplication? how can our liues be slow in passing; when that time which seemeth to stay them, driueth them forward to their iorneyes end? In which respect mans life is fitly compared to a weauers web; for as the wouen web continually encreaseth by the addition of threeds, so our age by the addition of daies; but as the more is added to the cloth, the lesse is vpon the beame, and the more the one increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,

Now if out of this halfe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, we would subduct so much time as is spent in ignorant and vnprofitable childhood, wherein we neither glorified God, nor did any good to Church or common wealth; so much as is consumed in sicknes of body, and discontent of mind; so much as is spent in doing nothing, or in doing that which is ill; so much as is crossed, and made miserable, by the sense or feare of some outward afflictions, or some inward griefe; and then look only on that part of time remaining which is spent in ioy, peace, contentment &amp; a good conscience, the which in truth only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth to be tearmed a life, al the other being but branches and degrees to death, we should easily perceiue that our liues might be measured with the short ell of a few daies. But if we will not enter into this consideration of the shortnes of our liues, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest it is passing, nor learne this lesson of our mortalitie, &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany continuance, neither by reason nor experience; yet shal we hereafter (when perhaps it wil be too late to make any good vse of our knowledge) easily both see, and seeing acknowledge

How many haue we seene passing their time in pleasures and delights, eating and drinking delicate and costly meates and drinks, in curious and more costly vessell and plate, spending their daies in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">Luk. 6. 25.</note> and hawking, laughing and sporting, dancing and reuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, who are now by death stripped of all their ioyes, and in all likelihood haue changed them for torments and miseries, weeping and gnashing of teeth, eternall woe and the sorrowes of hell?

Looke (saith one) into the graues of these great world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and see if you can discerne any print of their passed pride, or any signe remaining of their riches and luxuriousnesse.

What end is there now of both? Come neere and search their sepulchres▪ and behold there is nothing but dust, and the filthie reliques of the wormes feast: for this is the end of all humane<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Luc. 16. de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaro Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio. 2.</note> bodies, as wel of those who haue lead their liues in pleasure and delights, as of those who haue passed their daies▪ in painefull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. In which respect the world is fitly compared to a stage, and the life of man to a play, lasting a little longer then the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie time. For as in them one acteth the part of a king, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a begger; one of a wise counsellor, and another of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:10731:361"/> foole; and great difference there is between them whilest the comedie continueth; but when the play is ended, they are stripped of all their apparell, and hauing acted their parts, and come off the stage, they are all fellowes, and of equall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and condition: for euen hee who is greatest in the world, hath but a short part to act, and when it is done, hee must lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side all his glory, and become equal to him who is of basest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. And therefore seeing these glorious worldlings haue not much greater or longer happinesse, then he who acteth his part vpon the stage; let none be proud of such momentany felicity; let no man too much loue riches, or hate pouerty, because men are but personated in these worldly habits, and when the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlude is ended, they will be all alike.</p>
               <p>Neither are these worldly things wee possesse our owne, but<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 10. That the things we possesse are not our owne but the worlds heire-loomes.</hi>
                  </note> the worlds heire-loomes, which when wee are gone, must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnto posterity; for if they were truely our owne, then might we when we go, carrie them with vs; but now the world whose indeed they are, when we depart (whether wee will or no) will haue them all left behind, and keepeth them still in store to deceiue with them the following posterity, as before they haue deceiued their abused progenitors. In respect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Prophet <hi>Habakkuc</hi> saith, that the faithfull seeing the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie<note place="margin">Habac. 2. 6.</note> of wicked worldlings, <hi>shall take vp a parable, and a taunting prouerbe against them; saying, woe be to him that increaseth that which is not his, (how long?) and to him that in abundance hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vp to himselfe thicke clay.</hi> For death like a porter standeth in the gate, when men are to passe out of the world, and causeth them whether they will or no to leaue all behind them; sauing their sinnes which they haue committed in compassing these vanities. For well were it with wicked worldlings, if they could as well leaue their sin behind them as their sinfull posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; but this is their miserie, that when their gold forsaketh them, their guilt accompanieth them, and when they are pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vnwillingly from the things of the earth, whereupon they haue set their hearts, (which goeth as neere them as if their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy were pulled from their soule, or their heart out of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) their sins and the gaules of an euill conscience, which they haue gotten in compassing them, by wicked and vnlawfull meanes, doe attend as inseparablie vpon their soules, as their
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:10731:362"/> shadowes vpon their bodies, and will neuer leaue them, till they haue brought them to the fearefull tribunall of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and haue there by accusing them, caused the Iudge of heauen and earth, to pronounce against them the sentence of eternall condemnation.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I shewed that all men are of momentanie and<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 11. The shortnesse of their liues who are aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vnto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</hi>
                  </note> short continuance. Now let vs more specially consider of the breuitie and shortnesse of their liues who abound in all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prosperity; for so farre are these worldly things from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing our liues, and from establishing them against their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall frailty, that they rather cut them off and shorten them, as being the meanes when they are abused by sin, to bring vpon vs Gods heauie iudgements, and to hasten our death, when we too much set our hearts vpon them. And hence it is that in the Scriptures, there is not onely mention made generally of the frailty and momentany continuance of mans life, but more es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of theirs, who abound in all worldly prosperity. So it is said of those who are in honourable place and calling, that their aduancements shall not preserue them from the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of death; yea rather it is more ready to shoot at them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others, as being the fairest marke, and greatest conquest. So <hi>Eliphaz</hi> vseth an interrogation, the more to assure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince<note place="margin">Iob 4. 21.</note> vs of this truth. <hi>Doth not</hi> (saith he) <hi>their dignitie goe away with them? doe they not die, and that without wisedome?</hi> And the Psalmist telleth vs, that <hi>man shall not continue in honour</hi> (or as<note place="margin">Psal. 4. 12. 13.</note> the word signifieth, shall not stay in his estate all night) <hi>hee is like the beasts that die.

And though in respect of their honourable calling, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanceth them to the glorious title of Gods, yet he will not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute immortality vnto them, but telleth them, that <hi>though they were Gods they should die like men, and though they were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they though they abide with vs, preserue vs from death, that we also may stay with them; for death will not bee bribed, and the God of life and death will take no price for the redemption of our liues; for we haue nothing to giue but that which is his owne; and though all wee possesse were ours, yet it were not a price so sufficient as would be accepted.

For some outliue their heires, and hauing lost their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and kindred, are forced whether they will or no, to leaue vnto strangers the fruits of their labours. Others haue heires vnto whom they leaue their goods, but they are not sure that they shall enioy them; for the children do not alwaies rost that which their fathers caught in hunting; but as many enioy those goods which were neuer bequeathed thē, so many vnto whom they were bequeathed neuer doe enioy them, it being onely in their power to giue their riches, and bequeath legacies to whom they will, but not to maintaine their gift when they are gone, nor to vphold that right vnto which they haue intituled them. And this the Psalmist plainly affirmeth: <hi>Doubtlesse</hi> (saith<note place="margin">Psal. 39. 6.</note> he) <hi>man walketh in a shadow, and disquieteth himselfe in vaine; he heapeth vp riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.</hi> To the same purpose <hi>Iob</hi> saith, that <hi>though the children of wicked men bee</hi>

Though he should heape vp siluer as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay, he may prepare it, but the iust shall put it on, and the innocent shall diuide the siluer.</hi> Yea not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly strangers doe often become heires, but sometimes also ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and those whom a man in his life most hateth, after his death make a prey of his riches, and skornefully insult in his spoile. In which respect one saith, that the couetous mans la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour<note place="margin">Chrysost. ad pop Antioch. homil. 2. tom. 4.</note> is certaine, but the fruit of his labours vncertaine. For hee taketh paines and consumeth himselfe with cares in gathering riches, and after his death his inheritance and possessions come into the hands of his enemies, who haue circumuented him with innumerable trecheries, and taking onely with him his sins, he leaueth his substance to other men. Now what can bee more miserable, then to tire and spend a mans selfe with paines, that his enemies may reape all the profit? and to withhold euen necessaries from ones own vse, for the increasing of that wealth which his enemies will spend in superfluitie and excesse? In which respect one iustly much preferreth the riches of faith and a good conscience, before the wealth of the world. Faith (saith

And what more vaine, then to labor for other men, and not know who shall be his heire? For who can tell whether his owne sonne, or nephew shall suruiue him? seeing the heire oftentimes goeth before the testator to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall; or outliuing him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But though he knew who should inherit his labours, and be sure to haue an heire of his owne chusing; yet how can he tell what he will proue? whether a wise man, or a foole; a frugall sauer, or a wastfull spender; one who wil thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully remember his predecessor and benefactor, or one that will forget him, vnlesse it be to censure his infirmities?

But if these momentanie riches, which are thus bequeathed to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, haue been defiled with sinne, either because they haue bin vnlawfully gotten, as by greedie couetousnesse, fraud, deceit, cruelty and oppression; they will not proue greatly beneficiall, either to heire or predecessor: for as hee leaueth vnto his child his wealth, so also enuie, because he is the ofspring of such a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; (as it were) a yong one of the old serpent, which though<note place="margin">Plutarch de cupidit. diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarum.</note> he haue done no hurt hitherto by reason that he is yong, yet it is feared he will doe, when he commeth to age, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is likely to resemble his fathers nature, but also hath been poysoned with his precepts of couetousnesse in his very youth. For as one obserueth, when rich misers see that they can keepe their goods no longer then for tearme of life, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme &amp; strengthen their heiros, by reading vnto them lectures

For as meate it selfe being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately vsed becommeth wholesome nourishment, whereby the body is refreshed, and the life preserued; but if it bee eaten with a greedie appetite, and in excessiue measure, it oppresseth the stomacke, and becommeth the mother and nurse of all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases: so if we seeke these things with moderate loue, and in temperate measure, they will refresh and comfort our hearts and soules, so as they will be more cheerefull and strong in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the duties and workes of godlinesse; whereas if with a greedie desire we hunger after them, and not contenting our selues with sufficiencie, labour after superfluitie, our soules will be surcharged with a spirituall surfet, and the diseases of sinne which bring with them eternall death, will abound in vs to our destruction.</p>
               <p>Thus howsoeuer honors and earthly preferments are (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. That worldly honours bring muh hurt to those who dote vpon them.</hi>

Because ouerprizing them in their iudgement, and ouer sondly doting on them in their affection, and in both preferring them before those spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and heauenly excellencies; they will be accordingly ready at all times, to hazard the losse, yea to make a voluntarie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of those things, which in truth are infinitely better, so they may either gaine or retaine these worldly trifles, which in their deluded iudgement, and corrupted affection, they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to be of greater worth. For who seeth not that ambitious men immoderately louing, and excessiuely prizing honours, and the glory of the world, are ready to run headlong into all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of sinne, and by sinning, to hazard the losse of grace and glory, all opinion of vertue, and hope of happinesse, either for the compassing or maintaining of their reputation and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?

So that (as one saith) it is a matter of great difficultie to haue riches dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with vs, and not to be corrupted with their acquaintance
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:10731:369"/> and neighbourhood. The which as it is true of all wealth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately loued, so especially when in respect of quantitie it is growne to abundance and superfluitie; for as the ship when it is is ouerloded cannot be kept from sinking in the least tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, by all the care and cunning of the skilfull pilot, vnlesse it be vnburthened of some part of it lading; so when our minds are surcharged with these worldly superfluities, it is almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible with al our care and vigilance to keepe our soules from sinking into the gulph of sinne, vnlesse we vnburthen our selues of this abundance, by bestowing our superfluities on charitable vses, and in the relieuing of our poore brethren. In regard wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one truely saith, that hee who addeth to the wealth of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous man, giueth wine to him who is sicke of a burning fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, honie to a cholericke man, banquetting dishes to a sicke<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> and surfetted stomacke; which though they may please the tast, yet they increase the disease, and hurt in stead of helping. For they who abound in riches doe commonly keepe them like the vnprofitable seruants talent, doing no good with them to themselues or others; or else imploy them in such sinfull serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they were better to haue lien hid still, then to become the instruments of wickednesse, and furtherances vnto sin. As for example, when they are abused to surfetting and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and spent vpon harlots and parasites, in gaming and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling, in excessiue brauerie, or in furthering reuenge, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression and cruelty: for then they become the harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of hell, and like pioners, smooth and lay open the way which leadeth to destruction. In respect of which sinfull abuses, the Wise man saith, that hee had obserued, riches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued<note place="margin">Eccles. 5. 12.</note> to the owners thereof for their euill: and the sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>many are destroyed by reason of gold, and</hi>

                  <hi>haue found their destruction before them.</hi> And in regard of this harmefulnesse of abused riches, they are by one compared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thornes, as our Sauiour Christ also himselfe likeneth them: for as thornes are barren of fruits, so they of good workes; as they pricke the hands that touch them, so these the hearts that are set vpon them; as they are easily caught with the fire, and are hated of the husbandman, so these being hated of God, are easily consumed with the fire of his displeasure; and finally,<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Ioan. homil. 23.</note> as in them harmeful beasts, vipers, and scorpions do hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:10731:370"/> that they may doe a mischiefe at vnawares; so in these lurke many sinnes and corruptions which daily wound and sting the soule to death eternall. So elsewhere he asketh what happines there is in the possession of riches? vnlesse (saith he) we<note place="margin">Chrysost. in 1.

Vpon which manifold harmes happening through the abuse of riches, another groundeth an affectuall dissuasion from louing or seeking them ouermuch. How long (saith he) will you spend your liues in getting gold, which is nothing else but a snare of soules, the hooke of death, and baite of sinne? How long will ye greedily gape after riches, the vsuall causes of warre and discord? for for their sakes kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes neuer thinke what nature requireth; brethren behold one another with froward and crabbed countenances, and<note place="margin">Basil. orat. 14. de diuitijs &amp; paupertate.</note> thirst after one anothers blood; for their sake the woods har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour theeues, and cities sycophants and slandererers: who but they are the parents and patrons of lying, and the inuenters and framers of false accusations? what other author is there of periurie and trecherie? and yet they were giuen vs of God, for helpes to preserue life, and not as causes, occasions, and meanes to helpe vs forward in the course of wickednesse.</p>

Neither are these pleasures vnto them causes onely of sinne, but are also them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues turned into sinne, when as they vse them in excesse, or without moderation; for seeing their goodnesse wholly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in their iust measure, therefore when this measure is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,

For who seeth not that these immoderate pleasures, being loued and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; as surfetting and drunkennesse, chambring and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, venery and filthines, do both deforme the body, and bring it to a monstrous shape, making the eies red, the cheeks puft vp, or vntimely wrinkled, the teeth rotten, the breath stinking, and the belly swollen; and also do weaken the strength and impaire the health; loosening the sinewes, making the ioints and limbs lame, and filling euery seuerall part with grieuous diseases? In which respect they are fitly compared to sweet poisons, which are pleasant in the swallowing downe, but soone after they no lesse torment, then they did before delight, either bringing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature death, or grieuous inward diseases, &amp; outward sores: for so howsoeuer these pleasures do delight whilest they are in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, yet sometime they kill outright, and sometimes bring te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious sicknesses, which tormēt to death, with grieuous tortures.

It is now the time of our pilgrimage, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnfit to be spent in pleasures; we are now in our warfare, and therefore we must not be carpet Knights, pampring our selues with carnall delights, whereby we arme our enemies, and make our selues sluggish and vnfit to fight; for if earthly Kings thinke the campe vnfit for reuels, and liue in time of warfare frugally and painfully, making themselues an example vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to draw them on to the practise of their strait discipline, and all for the getting or keeping of a worldly Monarchie; why should we, who are in the Christian warfare, and continually as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted

Now if we would flie these car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall pleasures, we must take heed that we do neuer embrace them, for if they catch hold of vs they will hardly leaue vs; we must if it be possible be vtterly ignorant of them, and not so much as know them, that we may not couet them; for howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it may be thought a point of more Christian valour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne pleasures, when they allure vs with all their baits; yet it is more secure continencie, and a more safe victorie, if we do not so much as take notice of them. If we will not haue them defile<note place="margin">August. ad Paulinum. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. 34.

Finally, if we would easily part with them, let vs not by custome incorporate them and turne them into our nature; for as an ancient saith, It is one thing not to incorporate those things which are wanting, and another thing to pul them asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after they are incorporated; for those, like meats, are easily refused; but these, like members, are not cut off without exquisit torments, and intolerable paine.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I generally shewed, that these worldly things<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 5. That worldly things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our hearts from God.</hi>
                  </note> are very hurtful and pernicious to those who ouerualue them in their iudgements, and dote vpon them in their affections, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring them before Gods spirituall graces, and heauenly ioyes. Now for the better vnderstanding of this point, let vs a little more insist vpon it, setting downe more specially the manifold euils which these worldly things thus immoderatly loued pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and bring forth; al which may serue as so many effectuall reasons to disswade vs from this excessiue loue of the world and worldly things, seeing it is the mother of such a monstrous brood. And for orders sake I wil refer al these euils, either vnto those sinnes which hereby we commit directly against God, or those euils and mischiefes which through this immoderat loue are caused, both to our neighbours, and our selues. First there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these worldly things ouer-prised, and excessiuely loued, do make vs to neglect al dutie towards God, and to dishonor him diuers waies with many grieuous sins. For whereas we should
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:10731:372"/> cleaue vnto the Lord with all our hearts, louing, trusting, &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in him, wholly and solely, as being our chiefe goodnes, our omnipotent Creator, our al-sufficient preseruer, and most grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Father in Iesus Christ; this excessiue estimation and loue of the world and worldly things, doth weane our hearts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from God, and fixeth them vpon these vanities: for as our Sauiour hath taught vs, that which we esteeme our chiefe treasure, on that our hearts will be fixed &amp; seated. It is true that<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 21.</note> carnall worldlings would faine reconcile these two together, the loue of the world, and the loue of God, diuiding their harts betweene them, howsoeuer it be in very vnequal portions, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for euery dram of loue which they afford vnto God, they most willingly yeeld to the world a pound. But hereby they discouer themselues to be but meere hypocrites, which make shew of that which is not in them in truth; and those double<note place="margin">Iames 4. 8. Hosea 10. 2. Psalme 12. 2.</note> minded and double harted men, of which the Scriptures speak, who hauing, as the Psalmist saith, an heart and a heart, one for God, and another for the world, one for the seruice of their Creator, and another for the Tempter, are odious and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto God: for as it is monstrous in the sight of men, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold one looking with one eye vp to heauen, and with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eye downe vpon the earth; so is it no lesse monstrous in Gods sight, to see the heart diuided, one part seruing him, and another the world and the Prince thereof. But let such know that the loue of God, and the loue of the world are not only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, but flat contraries the one to the other, which cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siblie in any great degree, continue together in the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect; but as the loue of God increaseth, the loue of the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bateth;<note place="margin">Cui dulcescit Christus, ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rescit mundus.</note> and as the loue of the world getteth strength, the loue of God is weakened and diminished: and as the same piece of wax will not receiue at once, two prints of diuers seales; but the<note place="margin">

No maruell therfore if (the loue of the world hauing transformed them into it, and made them worldlings) the Lord cannot indure to haue such a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partner, or to haue his holy image conioyned with this missha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen monster, or to dwell in a corner of that house, whose fairest roomes are taken vp by Satan and the world. To this purpose<note place="margin">Bernard. de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scensione Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.

<pb n="672" facs="tcp:10731:373"/> things eternall, with those which are transitorie, of spirituall things with corporall, and heauenly with earthly, that we may at once sauor those things which are aboue, and those which are beneath: so that if we would tast how good the Lord is, we must first distast these earthly vanities; if we would be deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his sweetnesse, we must first learne to loath the worlds bitternesse; for it is impossible that both should rellish well at once, or that our hearts and affections should adhere both to God and the world, who are so farre distant and different, yea opposite and contrary the one to the other.</p>

Thus worldly honours being immoderately loued, doe take away all loue of God; and those who serue this idoll of vaine glory, they cannot be the seruants of Christ, as the Apostle speaketh. For so much doe they thinke of gracing themselues, that they neuer thinke of glorifying God; and so much doe they set their minds vpon their owne credit and aduancement, that they haue no heart to honour the Lord, further then it will stand with their owne preferment and reputation; yea so they may attaine vnto their owne vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious ends, they are ready to set the glory of God to sale, and to dishonour him, that they may honour themselues. So the earthly mammon if it bee affected with immoderate loue, will quickly weane our hearts from God; and if our treasures be in the earth, it is not possible that our hearts should bee in heauen.

<pb n="676" facs="tcp:10731:375"/> For when worldlings excessiuelie dote vpon the world and worldly vanities, they erect them for their idols in the shrines of their hearts, and giue vnto them diuine worship.

The which sinne is committed by worldlings, either properly and grossely, when as they worship idols of gold and siluer; an example whereof wee haue in the Israelites, of whom it is said, that as they abounded in these rich gifts of gold and siluer, so they multiplied their images: or as<note place="margin">Hos. 10. 1. 2.</note> they be hired with this wages of iniquitie, to commit idolatrie with these abominable idols made with hands, chusing rather to fall down before them, and adore them with diuine worship, then they will be depriued of their worldly profit and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. An example wherof we haue in <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped<note place="margin">Acts 19. 25.</note> the idoll <hi>Diand,</hi> and ragingly persecuted the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> not so much for loue to the image, or hatred to the Apostles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or doctrine, as because his idolatrie was aduantageable to him, and brought in with it earthly gaine and profit. Or else worldlings commit this idolatrie more improperly and couert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they displace God out of the temple of their hearts, and in stead of him set vp their idols of the world and worldlie vanities, by setting their affections wholly vpon them; in which respect this may be fitly called, the idolatry of the hart and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as the former was the idolatrie of the mind and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this idolatrie is committed by worldly men, when as they loue these earthly vanities more then God himselfe, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more care and paines both in getting and keeping them, and being more afraid of forgoing them, and more grieued for losing them, then for the enioying or losing of Gods fauour in this life, and his glorious and ioyfull presence in the life to come. So also when they put their trust and confidence in these worldly things, for the furnishing of them with al things which they desire, and for the freeing and deliuering them from all dangers; for howsoeuer these are rotten props to rest vpon, and weake helpes in time of need, yet so willing are men by nature, in the pride and sensualitie of their hearts, to leaue their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancie vpon God, and to depend vpon themselues, and visible
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:10731:375"/> meanes; that when they haue in plentie and abundance these earthly things in their possession, they are readie to relinquish God, and to trust in their owne prouidence and prouision, to blesse themselues in the fruition of their store, and thereby to thinke themselues safe and secure from any dangers. The which idolatrous confidence, as it doth raigne, and wholy beare sway in carnall worldlings, who so only rest in worldly things, that they are most confident when they haue them, and most despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate when they want them; so it sometimes tainteth Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest seruants; as we may see in the example of the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>

For who seeth not that the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious man loueth his honours and preferments better then his God? for he is readie so he may get them, to lose his loue; and preferreth the fauour of men before the fauour of God; not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how often he sinneth against both his knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, so he may hide his sinnes out of the sight of men, and by them compasse his ambitious designes. So also being aduanced to authoritie and power, in the pride of his heart he neglecteth God, and trusteth in his owne might and greatnesse; for supply of all that is good, and deliuerance from all which is euill.

Besides (as I haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) the more that worldly men abound with these earthlie things, the more their concupiscence is increased, and the more eager they are in seeking after more.

Whereas contrariwise if we should but remember the blessings which wee doe from God daily enioy; there is no man in the world so poore in his gifts, who might not finde rich matter of praise and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing; especially if he would cast his eye, not on those who are preferred before him, but on those to whom he is superiour; not on the things which hee wants and others enioy, but on those which he enioyeth, and they want. But so vnthankful our corrupt nature is, that we haue alwaies our finger vpon our sore, and our wants and grieuances in our memories, yea and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the fewer they are, the greater is our repining, complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that wee haue nothing, if wee haue not all; and the more rich we are in Gods blessings, the poorer commonly we are in thankfulnesse. And whereas in reason wee should (resembling golden vessels) reflect from gratefull harts, the beames of Gods shining benefits, with vnfained thankfulnes, and multiplie our praises and thanksgiuing, the more God multiplieth his gifts
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:10731:378"/> vpon vs: contrariwise we are most gratefull when wee receiue his benefits with a sparing hand, and better esteeme them, whē we enioy them but some few daies in the yeere, then if wee had continuall vse of them throughout our whole liues. And as our eyes doe worse see those obiects which are closest to them, and those better which in a conuenient distance are remoued from them; so we are most blind in seeing and acknowledging those benefits which we hold close in our possession, but better sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when they are a little remoued from vs. By reason of which our grosse ingratitude, the Lord is faine to pull from vs some of his gifts, that wee may be thankfull vnto him for the rest; to withdraw them for a time, that we may learne better to esteeme them for euer afterwards; and to depriue vs altogether of some of his benefits, that we who neuer thought of them, whilest we had them, may giue them deserued praise at parting; &amp; that we who were not thankful for that which we esteemed not whilest wee had it, may by the want learne the value, and duly estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it, may now be thankfull, if it be restored againe; or if not so, yet at least because once we had it. And thus <hi>Rehoboam</hi> was<note place="margin">2. Chron. 11. 4. <hi>&amp; 12. 1. 6.</hi>
                  </note> more thankfull because hee had two tribes left vnto him, then when he raigned ouer all the twelue. And <hi>Manasses</hi> returneth<note place="margin">2. Chron. 33. 12▪ 13.</note> praise to God for his restoring, who neuer thought of Gods mercie before he was restrained. Yea who may not obserue in his owne experience, that the more men abound in all worldly prosperitie, the more vngratefull they are vnto God for his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings; and that where he soweth the most seede of his rich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, there he commonly reapeth least fruits of thankfulnesse? who seeth not that they who are in honourable callings, take least care to honour God? and whereas they being aduanced aboue others, should as much excell them in thankfulnesse, as they doe in place: and in a liuely acknowledgement of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies towards them, should confesse his goodnesse before the sonnes of men, and being set in these high places, should like lights, shine to the glory of God in their liues and conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they commonly are more vnthankfull then those, who are in the meanest condition, and become examples and presidents of all sinne▪ and in stead of acknowledging the mercie of God in their honour and preferment, are readie to rob him of his glory, and to attribute all, either to their progenitors, the fauor
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:10731:378"/> of their prince, or their owne wisedome and well deseruing. So who are more vngratefull vnto God, then those who most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in riches? for so farre are they for the most part from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firing to shew their thankfulnesse in disposing of their riches to the glory of God that gaue them, in aduancing the meanes of his seruice, and in the workes of charitie, that they seldome so much as in their hearts acknowledge him for the author of all<note place="margin">Hab. 1. 16.</note> their welfare, but kisse their owne hands, <hi>sacrifice to their nets, and burne incense vnto their yarne; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous:</hi> attributing vnto their own wits and indeuours the praise of all which they possesse, as though by them alone they had out-stripped others, and made themselues owners of this plentie. Finally, who are lesse thankfull vnto God, then they who inioy most pleasures, and euen wallow themselues in worldly delights? For so wholly are they taken vp with their sports and pastimes, that they haue no time to consider how gracious the Lord is, nor how in his mercies hee doth abound towards them; and so are their minds, hearts, and affections fettered with their sensualitie, and belimed and clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with these carnall pleasures, that they are not able to lift them vp to heauen in any holie meditation, or to returne true thankfulnes vnto God, as being the fountaine of al their good. By all which it appeares, that these worldly benefits doe rather hinder, then further vs in thankfulnesse towards our benefactor, and consequently remaining vngratefull debters, who are not willing so much as to returne thankes for paiment, we deriue vnto our selues, the iust displeasure of our Lord and Master, and bring vpon vs a fearefull reckoning against the day of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, of which wee might bee discharged, if we would but thankfully owe the benefits which we haue receiued. In regard whereof one saith, that from these earthly good things when they grow great, there doe arise great euils, when as being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before others in the vse of our masters talents, we doe vse his gifts▪ as not giuen, returning no glorie to our benefactour. For so those who seemed greatest in respect of gifts receiued,<note place="margin">Bernard. ser. 84.</note> for not returning thanks, are reputed least in Gods estimate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea in truth, by so much a man is worse, by how much hee is better, if he ascribe vnto himselfe that wherein he excelleth, and so rob God of his deserued praise: euen as he is the greatest
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:10731:379"/> malefactor, and worthie of most punishment, who hath most goods in his possession, if he hath compassed them by theft, and by defrauding others of that which in right belonged to them.</p>

                  <hi>fat, and they haue spoken proudly with their mouth.</hi> And else where he saith, that because wicked worldlings were not in trouble like other men, but flourished in all plenty and prosperitie, <hi>ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they put on pride as a chaine about their necks,</hi> esteeming it no<note place="margin">Psalme 73. 6. 9.</note> disgrace vnto them, but a chiefe ornament: and not content to carrie themselues aloft in this high pitch amongst men, they are ready (as he saith) to talke presumptuously against God, and to set their mouthes against heauen. The which practise we also may obserue in our times, among the ruffling gallants of the world, who hauing bin alwaies nursed in the lap of prosperitie, and had all things which their hearts could wish, are readie in lieu of thākfulnes towards God, to despite him as it were to his face, and to pull him out of his throne by their oathes, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and bitter execrations. Whereby it appeareth that pride bordereth vpon prosperitie, and that these worldly vanities, though they do not truly nourish vs, and make vs grow in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall goodnes, yet they puffe vs vp, and make vs swell with the winde of vaine glorie; &amp; the greater our earthly abundance is, the greater commonly is our tumour, and consequently the greater is our torment; this spiritual swelling being to the soule, like the swelling of wind to the bodie, which (as I haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Of both which we haue many examples; as of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who in the pride of his heart opposed against the knowne will of God; and in <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> who beholding all his pompe, glorie and riches, attributeth the praise of all vnto himselfe, and robbeth God of the glory due vnto him, vanting himself in the pride of his heart, and arrogantly bragging; <hi>Is not this great Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi>

                  <hi>that I haue built for the house of the kingdome, by the might of my power, and for the honor of my maiestie?</hi> So it is said of <hi>Vzziah</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Chron. 26. 16</note> that finding the kingdom in a perplexed estate, he did vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the sight of the Lord, &amp; sought vnto him; for which when the Lord had made him to prosper, and to wax strong, his heart was lift vp to his destruction, and he transgressed against the Lord his God: yea good <hi>Ezechias</hi> was thus ouertaken, waxing<note place="margin">Psal. 131. 1. 2.</note> proud of his great prosperitie, and vanting himselfe in his rich treasures: and holy <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe, who had professed that his<note place="margin">2.

By all which it plainly appeareth, that worldly plentie is the nurse of hellish pride; for as fat commeth of the superfluitie of nourishment, wherby the bodie is made bigger, but not better, either in health, strength, or nimblenes: yea rather it is the nurse of many diseases, and maketh the bodie pursie, vnweldie, and vnfit for action: so this swelling of pride riseth from the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous abundance of worldly benefits, and maketh a man grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his owne conceit, but not in true worth; for the soule is not therby sounder in grace, or stronger and more actiue in the duties of pietie; yea contrariwise, this swelling of pride maketh way for all spirituall diseases, and causeth him who is infected with it, to be more sluggish and slothfull, vnweldie and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in all actions and duties of pietie and Christianitie.</p>

Thus <hi>Clitus</hi> magnified by the people for<note place="margin">Plutarch. de fort.

The like may be said of abundance of worldly riches, which are the bellowes of vaine glory, and the common causes of pride against God, who is the Author and fountaine of our wealth and welfare: whereof it is that the Lord so carefully admonisheth the Israelites, that when they should<note place="margin">Deut. 8. 12. 13. 14.</note> through his bountifull blessing abound in riches, they should take heed that their hearts were not lifted vp with pride: and that the Apostle would haue rich men so straitly charged that<note place="margin">1.

And this is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> cause why pride is vsually called the worme of riches, which breeding in them, eateth out al their goodnes, &amp; maketh them euil vnto vs, which are good in their owne nature; and hurtful &amp; pernicious, which in themselues are profitable and beneficial. So the Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> saith, that <hi>riches lift vp the mind;</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> telleth vs, that <hi>the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ecclesiasticus 40. 26. Prou. 28. 11.</note>
                  <hi>rich man is still wise in his owne conceit, though a poore man of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding can trie him,</hi> &amp; discerne his folly. To which purpose one saith, That there is nothing so much to be feared in riches<note place="margin">August. Serm. 712. Tom. 10.</note> as pride, &amp; that we are not to feare riches themselues, but pride which is the disease of riches: for that mind is of great vertue and magnanimitie, which in the abundance of riches is not infected with this disease, &amp; being in an high estate, is not also high min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. He is a rich man truly great, who doth not therefore thinke himselfe great, because he is rich, whereas he who taketh all his
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:10731:380"/> worth from his wealth, may be truly said to be full of pride, but empty of goodnes and desert; a boaster outwardly in his words and looks, but inwardly a begger in his mind and hart; swelled and puffed vp with vain glory; but not ful &amp; solide in vertue and true worth. And yet this empty pride swelleth and puffeth vp, as much as any other; and is full of insolencie, though in respect of the ground and cause thereof, it be in truth most base and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. For as the pride arising from the bodie is more base, then the pride which is grounded on the gifts of the soule, so the pride of riches which are no part of the person, is more base then the pride of bodily gifts; because being seated and groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on those things without a man, which are farre inferiour to the gifts either of mind or body, they who are proud of them plainly shew, that they haue nothing within, and in their owne persōs, worth respect; or els they would neuer be proud of those things which are without, seeing a man alwaies groundeth his pride on those things; wherein he thinketh he most excelleth. The which if men would duly consider, they might well leaue this contemptible pride, if not because it is a sin, yet at least for shame, seeing it doth discouer their vanity and worthlesnes: for who would not blush to seeme proud of outward accidents, which may be won and lost, and (as one saith) bought and sold<note place="margin">Glemens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandr. Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dag. lib. 2. cap. 3</note> on the market hill? which when we haue them, adde nothing to the perfection of our persons, and being taken away, nothing is detracted from our essence, (yea in truth) from our worth: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the mind made greater, or more magnanimous by desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or hauing, but by light valuing and contemning them as worthlesse trifles, in comparison of things desirable and truely excellent. And yet nothing more commonly puffeth men vp with most insolent pride, then riches and abundance; &amp; though like emptie bladders they haue nothing but skin, they are made full with these vanities; and swell in conceit, though they are as emptie of any substantiall goodnes, as they were before. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample whereof we haue in the Merchants of Tyre, who because<note place="margin">Ezech. 28. 2. 5.</note> by their trading they had increased their riches, their harts were lifted vp, and thinking themselues more then men, they arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to themselues the titles of God. But we shall not need to go so far to fetch examples, seeing we haue many such in our owne daies, who measuring their worth according to their wealth,
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:10731:381"/> most proudly conceit their owne excellencie, and insult ouer al others as worser, who are poorer; though they be vtterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnished of al gifts and good parts both in body and mind, and as far short of them in wisdome &amp; worth, whom they cōtemne, as they are before them in earthly abūdance. Although in truth there is no shew of cause, seeing there is no cōparison betweene the gifts of mind and body, and the gifts of an outward estate. And besides, if there be any excellencie at all in these earthly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, it is not in keeping &amp; possessing them, but in their bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and vse: neither is he in the Church and among Christians<note place="margin">

Finally, thus worldly pleasures cause pride, as they are the vsuall meanes to make vs forget God, and to forget our selues, causing vs like pampred horses to scorne our master; especially if our delights be of such a nature, as that therein we may shew our excellencie, and commend to those who are about vs the gifts of body or mind, which selfe-loue maketh vs beleeue, to be esteemable.</p>
               <p>In all which respects these worldly things thus abused, may<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 5. That worldly things causing pride▪ are also the causes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</hi> Prou. 6. 17. and 16. 5.</note> be truly said, not only, not to do vs any good, but contrariwise much hurt, seeing they are the means to cast vs into this hainous sin of pride, which aboue all others God detesteth, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures testifie. And as he doth hate the sin, so he purposely oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and setteth himselfe against those who are defiled with it; and because the proud man opposeth against God, robbing him of his glory which is most deare vnto him; therefore the Lord also opposeth against him, and crosseth him in al his courses. So the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saith, that <hi>God resisteth the proud, but giueth grace to the humble.</hi> The which opposition and resisting of God who is omnipotent, must needs bring them to ruine and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, seeing their policies cannot ouer-reach his infinit wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, nor al their strength defend thē from being ouerthrowne by his mightie power; especially seeing his will to bring them to confusion, is ioyned with his abilitie, the Lord neuer more willingly shooting his arrowes of wrath and vengeance, then against the proud person. So the blessed Virgin in her▪ song saith, that God <hi>scattereth the proud in the imagination of their</hi>

                  <hi>himself shal be brought low, and he that humbleth himselfe, shal be exalted.</hi> As therfore mē lift vp highest those earthen pitchers which they purpose to breake with greatest violence, into most pieces; so the Lord intending to batter and bruise these fraile persons puffed vp with pride, doth lift them vp on high, that he may giue them the sorer fall. And howsoeuer the Lord who is chiefe iudge of heauen and earth, is the punisher of all vice and sin, yet because he executeth this vengeance more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, and seuerely vpon proud persons, therefore the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> maketh it one of Gods attributes and titles, whereby he will be knowne to be a punisher of them; <hi>O thou who destroyest</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 21.</note>
                  <hi>the proud, and wicked, which erre from thy commandements, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from me shame and contempt, because I keepe thy testimonies.</hi> And as he beareth an extraordinarie hatred vnto this sin aboue others, so he inflicteth on it extraordinarie punishments; bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it as an hainous and capitall offence, by imposing on it his greatest plagues. For whereas proud men in their ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires would be equall with God, the Lord pulleth them downe in his fierce wrath, and maketh them lesse then men; for he stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them commonly with frenzie and madnesse, and thereby depriuing them of the vse of reason, the essentiall forme of man, wherein chiefly his manhood consisteth, and whereby he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from the brutish creatures, he maketh them equall<note place="margin">Dan. 4. 27. 28. 30.</note> with beasts, and so exposeth them, how great soeuer they were in former times, to the contempt, derision, and iniuries of the basest and meanest, who before held them in such great respect, that they could not looke vpon them, or stand in their presence, but with much feare and reuerence. A plaine example whereof we haue in <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> who for his pride was driuen from his palace and regall throne, into the wild woods, and made of a great monarch and ruler of men, a companion with beasts, and farre worse then his basest seruant. And the like we may obserue in many in our owne times, who offending in this sinne, are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne with this punishment. For howsoeuer all excessiue pride is not thus punished (for then there would not be enow in their right wits to tend and rule those who are madde) yet a man shall seldome see this punishment following, where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:10731:382"/> pride hath not gone before. So that one may boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that if pride onely bee not plagued with this fearefull iudgement of frenzie and madnesse, yet it is more often thus punished then all other sins besides. The which fierce and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vengeance of God, which he taketh on proud persons, the Prophet <hi>Malachie</hi> expresseth, by comparing Gods wrath bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning against them, to a burning furnace, and proud men to stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>The day of the Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>commeth, that shall burne as an</hi>

                  <hi>ouen; and all the proud shall be stubble, and the day that commeth shall burne them vp, saith the Lord of hosts, and shall leaue them neither root nor branch.</hi> And therefore seeing these worldly things are the common causes of pride, and pride bringeth with it such confusion and destruction, let this serue as an argument to make vs contemn these harmeful vanities, not immeasurably desiring them when we want them; nor excessiuely esteeming and immoderately louing them when wee haue them; and so if we want these things which we neglect, our minds will not be much deiected; or if we haue them, they will not bee much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted and lifted vp; neither can a man be proud of the possession of that which he doth not ouerualue in his iudgement, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurably loue in his affection.</p>
               <p>The sixth sin against God, which these worldly things too<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. That worldly things bring with them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God.</hi>
                  </note> much esteemed, &amp; immoderately loued plunge vs into, is either neglect or vtter contempt of God himselfe, his spirituall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and heauenly ioyes; for our affections being finite are limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and restrained to their obiects, so that being conuersant and exercised about some, they in the meane time neglect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And therefore if they cannot with their full vigour and heate affect many things being diuers; how much lesse can they at once loue God and the world, spirituall graces and earthly vanities, eternall ioyes, and these transitorie trifles, seeing they are opposite and contrary the one to the other? And this our Sauiour Christ teacheth vs, where as hee saith, that <hi>no man</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 13.</note>
                  <hi>can serue two masters; for either he must hate the one and loue the other, or else he shall leane to the one, and despise the other; ye cannot serue God and riches.</hi> So that there is no halting betweene the Lord, and this worldly Baal, for the seruice of the one, is the contempt of the other, and the louing of the one, is the hating of the other. It is true indeed in reason that the more we abound
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:10731:382"/> with these earthly benefits, the more we should loue, reuerence, and with all diligence and alacritie serue the Lord, they being his bountifull gifts and blessings whereby hee deserueth at our hands his loue and seruice; howbeit such is the corruption of our hearts, that no sooner are we inriched with these worldly benefits, but wee presently loue the gifts better then the giuer; and laying herein aside all reason, wee become like beasts, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon our prouender, and neglecting our feeder; and the more we are pampered and made fat, the more ready we are to kicke against him. An example whereof we haue in the people of Israel, of whom the Lord complaineth, that whereas in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the manifold benefits which hee had multiplied vpon them, they should haue serued him in vprightnesse of heart; they contrariwise by his gifts were made more rebellious: <hi>But he</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>that should haue been vpright, when he waxed</hi>

Or though they should thinke of grace and glory with some desire to compasse them, or would lift themselues vp in any spirituall contemplation, yet as birds with great bodies, though they haue wings, cannot flie aloft, but when they attempt it, are pulled downe with their owne waight, and onely flutter vpon the earth; so though they haue spirituall soules, vnderstandings, and iudgements as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

To which purpose one saith, that if we desire earthly things, wee are wholly taken vp with the care of them; and so farre are wee beaten backe from heauenly contemplatiō, by how much we are ouerpoysed with the cares of earthly affaires. But say notwithstanding this blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they might haue some glimpse of the shining brightnesse of spirituall grace and heauenly glory, or wanting this, should haue it by others described vnto them, so that some knowledge of these diuine excellencies, might by the passage of the eare, be deriued to their vnderstandings; yet being wholly possessed with the loue of worldly things, they would little regard such discourses, and accounting these earthly vanities their chiefe treasures, their hearts are so fast fixed vpon them, that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion will moue them to leaue them, or once to looke after those spirituall and diuine excellencies. For as hee who loueth truely his God, doth not much loue his gold, because hee estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him his chiefe treasure; and as hee who highly esteemeth heauenly happinesse, doth presently contemne these earthly<note place="margin">

And this our Sauiour plainely teacheth vs in the parable of the guests inuited to the mariage
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:10731:383"/> supper; for they who were best disposed framed excuses, one that he had bought a farme, and must needs goe out and see it; another that he had bought fiue yoke of oxen, and must goe to proue them, and another that he had maried a wife, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Luk. 14. 18. 19.</note> could not come; all which though they pretended faire excuses, as though their desire had been to come, if their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses had not been so vrgent, yet the true cause was, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour telleth vs, because doting vpon their earthly affaires, they<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 5.</note> were so wholly taken vp of them, that they made light of these heauenly offers, and went their waies. And those who were worse affected, &amp; caried with greater violence in their loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards worldly vanities, tooke it so ill, that the messengers of<note place="margin">vers. 6.</note> the great king, should presume to dissuade them from the loue of their chiefe iewels, and most esteemed treasures, that they laid violent hands vpon them, sharpely intreated them, and cruelly murthered them. Thus those who set their hearts vpon worldly honours, neuer thinke of eternall glory, but spend all their thoughts and labour in plotting the meanes whereby they may aspire to earthly preferments; and if any shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to leaue these courses, and contemning the vaine glory of the world seeke after heauenly honour which shall be eternall; and to glorifie God by their holy liues, and humble ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that he may glorifie them in his heauenly kingdome; they will plainely shew their neglect and contempt of these e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting honours, by despising, if not deriding these christian admonitions and persuasions. So hee who too much esteemeth, and immoderately loueth earthly riches, doth neglect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the Lord, and the vnualuable riches of his spirituall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and heauenly treasures; being ready with <hi>Iudas</hi> to sell this<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 15.</note> Sauiour for a little money, and with <hi>Demas</hi> to forsake all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion<note place="margin">Psal. 10. 3.</note> with the saints, to imbrace the world.

And if any man shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade them to alter their couetous courses, and to lay vp their treasures, not in earth, but in heauen, because wee cannot haue a treasurie in both places, nor serue God if we serue mammon;<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 14.</note> they are ready to laugh them to frome, as the Pharifies did our Sauiour Christ; and euen to persecute them to the death, if they too earnestly insist in this argument. The like also might bee said of worldly pleasures, which being ouerualued, and too much affected, make men in comparison of them, to neglect the ioy in the holy Ghost▪ yea the ioyes of heauen, and those surpassing pleasures which are at Gods right hand for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. And as the hog feeding vpon the mast and swill which he naturally loueth, and wallowing himselfe in the filthie mire, will not exchange his grosse feed, for the daintiest meats, not his lothsome lodging for a bed of downe: so they being wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to these sensuall and carnall delights, which are base and brutish, are ready in comparison of them to set light by, and contemne the spirituall ioyes of a christian, and the eternall ioyes of heauen, as though they were not worth the seeking and desiring. And therefore seeing the loue of God and these heauenly excellencies, and the loue of the world, and worldly vanities will not stand together, but hee who in his heart and affection imbraceth the one, doth presently neglect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the other, let this also serue as an effectual reason to wean our hearts from these earthly trifles, seeing if we giue them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, and vouchsafe them too high a seat in the temple of our hearts, they will instantly thrust out the loue of the Lord, and his inualuable benefits; and by our neglect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt make vs to lose those incomparable treasures, for this earthly trash, and worthlesse trifles.</p>

And as those who haue drunke poysons doe presently wax stiffe and benummed, and soone after are seazed vpon by death, whereby they are made impotent and vtterly vnable to performe any humane action: so they who haue drunke of that benumming poyson of cold contempt, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pising God and his rich graces, spirituall, and eternall, are made first sluggish, and soone after impotent, and dead to all good duties. Neither is this rare and vnusual to see those vpon whom the world fawneth, and who abound with earthly prosperity, to be thus slacke and negligent in the seruice of God, and in vsing the meanes of their owne saluation; but so common and almost vniuersall, that seldome shall one find a man in great prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who also is indued with great piety; seldome shall one see<note place="margin">Et rarae sumant soelicibus ara.</note> any burning in zeale, and deuout and earnest in religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who hath the world at will, and hath plentie and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all earthly blessings. It is true indeed, that in reason these temporarie benefits, should as the Lords wages, incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage vs to doe his worke; and hauing a tast of his bountie, of which wee shall drinke our fill in the life to come, wee should with more alacritie and cheerefulnesse performe diligent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to so liberall a master: But contrariwise through our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and vnthankfulnesse it commeth to passe, that wee are rather hindered then furthered in all good duties by worldly abundance; and like gluttons and drunkards hauing store and plentie of these good blessings, wee feeding on them with a greedie appetite do surfet, and drinking of these full cups with vnsatiable thirst, wee are made drunken with excesse; and so thereby our heads are intoxicated, our minds besotted, and our bodies enfeebled and disabled, so as wee become slothful and impotent to performe any good dutie of the seruice of God; whereas by their moderate vse, we might haue been made more
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:10731:385"/> strong and cheerful for these holy actions, and religious exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. And thus this worldly prosperity and earthly abundance draweth men frō performing vnto God▪ y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> duties of his worship and seruice, and from vsing the means of their own saluation; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as it vtterly hindreth them from performing these Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an duties, which is the case of prophane worldlings, who do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon these earthly vanities, are so wholly taken vp in busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and imploiments about either the getting, keeping, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing them, that they can find no leisure at all, either to vse in their owne families the exercises of prayer, reading, meditation; or to come vnto the congregation, to heare▪ the word, receiue the sacraments, or to cal publickly vpon the holy name of God: or els if they formally performe these duties, it hindreth them, as it doth distract their minds in prayer, and hearing the word, and carrie away their hearts, so as they doe not attend at all to those holy exercises which they haue in hand; or else carelessely, lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishly, wearily, and without all life and feeling; which is the case of temporizers, and formall worldlings, who for some car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall respects make an outward profession of religion. And not onely they, but euen Gods dearest children are thus ouertaken, through the immoderate loue of these vanities; so as they some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neglect these holy duties of Gods seruice, and meanes of their owne saluation, and sometimes performe them with much distraction, dulnes, and wearinesse, as appeareth in the example of <hi>Martha,</hi> who being cumbred with worldly businesse, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected<note place="margin">Luke 10. 41: 42.</note> to hearken vnto our Sauiour Christ.

And this was one reason why our Sauiour Christ for the preaching and planting of the Gospell, made not choice of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable persons, or of those who abounded in wealth, and wallowed in worldly pleasures, because such, in regard of their fearefulnes, to lose their earthly loue and delight; were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnfit to expose themselues to dangers, &amp; to beare the brunt of persecution; but of poore and contemptible fishermen;<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 9. 10.</note> whō also he inhibited the possession of much gold, siluer, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and the riches of the world, because they should be no clogs or hinderances vnto them in their confession of him, and his truth, and in suffering for his names sake.

But such should remember, that when the Lord ordained congregations, and places of common assemblies, hee appointed not a temple for the common people, and a chamber or chapell for the nobilitie; but noble and base, yea King and subiect, were commanded to meet together, because by a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all consent, and holy example, they might incourage one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and performe the seruice of God with more alacritie. For howsoeuer there are diuers degrees amongst men in ciuill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, yet in respect of God, and in the duties of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, they are all alike the seruants of God, brethren and sons of the same Father, fellow members of the same bodie, and of the same communiō of saints, of which, Christ Iesus is the head and King. From which common order, though Princes may in these daies be exempted, in regard that we are not strictly tied to the temple but may in all places offer vp pure hands vnto God; and because of their great families sufficient in themselues to make a sufficient congregation; and especially because the sinfulnes of the times is such, and mens minds so poisoned with treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:10731:386"/> and blood▪ thirstie crueltie, that Kings and Princes cannot with safetie to their persons and states, come into common as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies; in which respects, necessitie and charitie may well dispence with cicumstances and ceremonies: yet I can see no reason, why Nobilitie should pleade this priuiledge of exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or for state seuer themselues from the publicke congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and assemblies of Gods Saints, especially, seeing it is vnto themselues so hurtfull and pernicious.

These are the causes why Iudges and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates peruert righteous iudgement, acquitting the guiltie, and condemning the innocent, calling good euill, &amp; euil good; right wrong, and wrong right; namely, that they may hereby attaine their worldly ends, and aduance their prosperitie, and earthly estates. These are the hire of all corruption, oppression, and crueltie, which are exercised of superiours towards their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, rulers towards their subiects, and landlords towards their tenants, that they may maintaine their greatnesse, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their wealth, or carnall pleasures. In a word, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most no vniustice committed, if it do not proceed from malice, and desire of reuenge; which is not caused and occasioned by these worldly things immoderately loued: men not caring what they do, nor what meanes they vse, whether they be good or euill, right or wrong, so they may maintaine the prosperitie of their estate, and encrease their worldly happinesse.

For that which a man doth to one, hee suffereth of another; wickednes rebounding vpon the author, and the oppressor being oppressed by that example which himself hath giuen. But this wil better appeare in the speciall instances: and first for honours; there is nothing more then they, being immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately loued, which wil thrust men into all outragious and pernicious courses for the obtaining of them. For when the ambitious man wanteth true worth and lawful means to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance himself into y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> seat of honor, he is ready to make steps, whereby he may ascend, of any mischiefe or villanie; betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those that trust him, treading on their necks who helped him to rise, falsly accusing, supplanting, yea poysoning, &amp; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly murthering those who stand in his way, and hinder his preferments.

                  </note> iniuries, which men through the immoderate loue of these worldly vanities do vsually offer vnto their neighbors; which although many about them may escape, yet all haue iust cause to feare, seeing in offering a wrong to one, they threaten it against all; especially if their power be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to their will, they being so mighty in themselues, or so backed with their potent friends, that no man dare make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,<note place="margin">Qui vni facit iniuriam om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus minatur.</note> or once call their actions in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But if they be wanting in this power and ability, so as they cannot doe what they would; yet are their wils neuer wanting to doe what wrongs they can; and when they are able to doe no more, they cease not to enuie and maligne those who exceed them in worldly prosperity, hauing in their possession those things which they desire, and inwardly they repine at them, because they haue that which themselues want, whom selfe-loue maketh them beleeue to be much more worthie.
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:10731:391"/> And thus those who dote vpon worldly honours enuie and hate all those who are preferred before them, desiring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, then that they may outgrow them in aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or if not so, yet that the other may fall and so become equal vnto them. So also they who set their harts vpon riches are filled with enuie and hatred, when they see others thriue faster, and to abound in greater plentie; and though they haue no other quarrell against their neighbour, yet this is cause enough of a deepe conceiued grudge, if they exceed them in wealth; which enuie and repining they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly take away by al the humanity they can shew towards them, neither is there any thing but their losses, want, and miserie that can giue them contentment, and worke a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation. To which purpose one saith, that the couetous<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Mat. 26. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 81.</note> man hateth all men both poore and rich. The poore, fearing lest they will beg of him; the rich, because they haue that which hee would possesse. For he thinketh that all men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy those things which of right appertaine vnto him; and therefore as though he were hurt of euery man, hee is angrie with all. The like also might bee said of worldly pleasures, which are the common causes of this enuie and hatred, to those that set their hearts vpon them. They being ready to grudge and disdaine if any exceed them in daintie fare, and full tables, or in more stately shewes, maskes, and reuels, or in variety of delightfull sports and pastimes.</p>

                  </note> blessings, being ouerualued and immoderately loued, doe puffe men vp with pride, and make them carrie themselues insolently and disdainefully towards their neighbours; vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their superiors as though they were their equals, neglecting their equals, as though they were their inferiors, and proudly insulting ouer their inferiours as abiects, and base vnderlings. And as waterish humours abounding in the bodie doe cause a dropsie, which swelleth it much aboue the ordinarie measure, and filleth it so full, that it is neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bursting: so these worldly and waterish vanities do make mens hearts and minds subiect to this dropsie of pride, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

So that a man shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne a meruellous alteration in the same person, in respect of his different estate and condition; for whereas when hee was but of meane qualitie, or touched with some affliction, he was humble, affable, and ful of courtesie; when the crosse is remooued, and he aduanced, flourishing in prosperity, and euen wallowing in his abundance; presently his cariage and behauior is quite changed; and now he swelleth with pride, ouer looketh all that meete him, scarce vouchsafeth a side glance, or a complemental salutation vnto those, with whom formerly he was most familiar, and will scarce know his best benefactors, lest his proud heart should be disquieted, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest hee is forced to remember that hee was beholding; or those of his acquaintance, who were formerly much better then he, lest his pride should receiue any checke, whilest he is put in mind, that he was an vnderling.

It is true, that all men are proud by nature, vntill grace do subdue it, and bring humility; but yet there are many, who make no shew of it in a meane estate, wanting meanes and opportunity, which might, as it were, set fire to the powder of their corruption. And as the Serpent may bee safely handled when hee is stiffe and benummed with cold, though all his poison be still in him; but beginneth to hisse when hee feeleth the least warmth, and is ready to sting those, when he is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heated, who for pitie tooke him vp and put him into their bosoms: so this poison of pride lurketh secretly and lieth hid in mens hearts, when it is pinched, and, as it were,

And howsoeuer in their low estate they might easily haue been ruled and led, and like ships without sailes and tackle, were readie to yeeld themselues ouer to the streame and tide of other mens desires, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling perswasions; yet now hauing attained vnto prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and worldly abundance, as it were, vnto their full sailes; they are onely carried with the wind of their owne pride,<note place="margin">

So that these worldly vanities are the borrowed feathers and wings of pride, whereby men soare aloft in the high pitch of their owne conceits; which when they are pulled, or clipt by some

And hence it is, that the Lord feeling, like a skilfull Physition, the lofty beating pulses of great potentates, and finding them inclinable to fall into the frenzie of pride, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth Kings and Princes, for the tempring and abating of their proud spirits, to haue his law continually before them, that when the greatnesse of their place did lift them vp, they might be humbled by knowing, and continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, that burthen of dutie which did lie vpon them. <hi>When</hi> (saith he) <hi>the King shall sit vpon the throne of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>

So the Psalmist saith, that <hi>they</hi>

The like also might be said of worldly pleasures, which being inioyed with immoderate loue, and in excessiue measure, doe make men wanton, proud and insolent; like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto pampred horses, which being fatted with prouender will stand on no ground, nor indure to be ruled with any ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; whose pride and brauerie lasteth no longer then they are well fed: for so these voluptuous wantons being pampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with carnall delights, grow proud of their pleasures, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowing themselues nor others: but when they are skanted of their full tables, and are depriued of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

                  </note> and worldly things is in respect of God, and how many mischiefes it causeth towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; it now followeth, that I also shew, that as it is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and pernicious vnto others, so most of all to themselues, who are possessed of it, as being the cause of innumerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils and mischiefes, and those both temporary and eternall. The temporarie euils which these worldly things immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately loued, bring to those who dote vpon them, are either ciuill, and meerely humane; else such as are spirituall, respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the soule, and the inner man. The euils of the former sort are diuers: for first, the prosperitie of the world, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of earthly blessings, doe soften and effeminate the heart and mind, making men impatient in bearing the least crosse, and impotent in performing any thing, wherein is any difficultie and labour: for prosperitie and plentie cause wantonnesse, and wantonnesse way wardnesse, if they be but touched with the least cause of griefe: and hauing been long inured to tread onely in the soft path of worldly happinesse,
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:10731:394"/> their feet are made so tender, that the least hardnesse of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse accidents putteth them to paine, and the least paine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them to crie out, being made intollerable not in it selfe, but through their impatiencie in suffering it. Thus these worldly honors weaken and soften the mind, making it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient in bearing the least iniurie, or shew of wrong, yea though it be but the suspition of a small neglect. Or if by su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior powers, by whom they were aduanced, and by whose grace they stand, they bee but a little frowned vpon, they presently fearing a downefall, or doubting that they shal rise no higher, haue their hearts broken, or at least, fretted and consumed with griefe; whereas others, who either neuer had these honours, or neuer much esteemed them, hauing the comfort of a good conscience within thē, feare no frownes, and beare with patience vndeserued disgraces, and the losse of those honours, which they neuer highly valued. So also riches immoderately loued, soften the heart, and weaken the resolution of those that haue them, making them cowardlie in attempting any thing which is good, if the least shew of danger be in it, either to their person or estate; equally fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the losse of their liues, and the hazard of their wealth, lest either by the one, they should be taken from their idoll, or by the other, it should bee taken from them. The latter whereof is more grieuous vnto them then the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by the prolonging of their life, after the losse of their riches, their sorrow is continued, whereas the griefe which they sustaine, for being taken from their wealth, is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by death, which maketh them senslesse in feeling their losse. By which feare and cowardize possessing their hearts, they are made altogether vnwilling to stand in any cause for Gods glory, the defence of iustice and truth, or for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of the Church or Common-wealth, if any supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour powers doe oppose against them: yea, they are readie instruments, euen of those mischiefs, which their consciences do condemne and abhor, rather then they wil by incurring their displeasure, hazard themselues to be fleeced of any of their wealth. Againe, they are hereby made so impotent,
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:10731:394"/> and impatient of bearing any losse, that many, who haue bin suddleny, &amp; as it were, vnseasonably (before they could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their minds, and gather their spirits) depriued of some smal share of their abundance, and pruned of their superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, haue murthered themselues, and like the Vine, haue bled to death of these sleight wounds, hauing no patience so much as to thinke of outliuing their losse. For after that the loue of riches hath once softned their hearts, they are made weake, cowardly, and vnable to indure any thing; and shew themselues onely patient and strong in induring the base ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude of their riches, and in vndergoing al those seruile and painefull offices, wherein they will imploy them. To this purpose one saith, that Christian fortitude fleeth couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">Ambros. offic. lib. 1. cap 39.</note> as being a blot or blemish vnto vertue, which doth ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate and weaken it; neither is there any thing so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto true fortitude and magnanimitie, as to bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with gaine. Finally, voluptuous pleasures being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately loued and affected, do as much, if not more then any thing, eneruate vertue, and weaken the heart and mind; making them, though they be naturally couragious, soft and effeminate, when men too much are addicted to them. For when leauing labour and manly exercises, they betake them to carnall delights, inuring themselues to daintie fare, and soft lodging, and spending their whole time in chambring and wantonnes, dancing and reuelling, sports and pastimes, these <hi>Circes</hi> cups bewitch and poison them, and causing them to lay aside all manlinesse, do at best change them into weak women, or which is worse, transforme them into filthy swine, abhorring all paines and labour, and taking all their delight to wallow themselues in the filthie puddle of carnall pleasures. And these cursed <hi>Dalilaes,</hi> lulling them asleepe in their laps with their sweete and enchanting songs, doe take away from them all their strength, and so enfeebling them, make them to bee easily ouercome of any vice or sinne, and readie to yeeld vnto any tentation of Satan or the world. So one saith, that in pleasures, the heart is made more soft and<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Matth 12. homil. 41.</note> flexible; but in affliction and time of mourning, it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:10731:395"/> it selfe, and, as it were, gathereth all it forces together;<note place="margin">Cyrus apud Iustin. hist. li. 1.</note> and so returning to it selfe, it affecteth moderation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freed from the burthen and tyrannie of passions, it is made stronger and more nobly lofty. And hence it is, that politicke conquerours, hauing with great danger and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie vanquished and ouercome some warlike nations, haue to keepe them still vnder, despoiled them of their armes, and in stead of warlike exercises, drawne them to banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, gaming, and reuelling, that so their courage might bee abated, and their hearts softned and effeminated with these pleasures and delights. And therfore if we make any account of Christian fortitude &amp; magnanimity, which chiefly defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs against our enemies, if we would not haue our manly courage, changed into womanish weaknes, let vs not immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratly loue worldly prosperity, nor vnmeasurably affect ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honors, riches, or carnal pleasures, which take away both our patience in suffering, &amp; our strength in performing, &amp; so make vs vnable for any Christian, yea man-like imploiment.</p>
               <p>A second euill or mischiefe which worldly prosperity, and<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2 That the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of worldly vanities make men to stand in need of many things.</hi>
                  </note> abundance of earthly things bring vnto those who inioy thē with immoderate loue, is, that by their plenty they bring vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them a necessity, &amp; make them to stand in need of many things (wheras nature is content with a few) the want of the least whereof causeth vnto them sorrow and discontent: for by the vsuall accustoming of themselues to superfluities, they alter the course of their natures, and make them to become necessarie; and whereas those who neuer vsed them, neuer need them, nature in it selfe being as well content without them as with them; contrariwise those who haue inured thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto them, hauing turned custome into a second na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cannot want them without a maime. In which respect worldly men abounding with these earthly things, are in a farre worse condition then those who neuer had them; for as he who by continual vse of Physicke, hath brought his body to such a disposition, that he can enioy no health, vnlesse he continually be taking medicines, nor digest a meale without the helpe of hot waters, is in a far worse estate, though he had
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:10731:395"/> the best Physitions to tend him, and a whole Apothecaries shop at his command, then a poore labouring man who nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth neither cordial, pill nor potion, but without these helps, eateth his meat with a good appetite, and well digesting it, hath it turned into good nourishment, though he haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Physition to counsel, nor drug to purge him, because his nature &amp; constitution is so strong, that he needeth them not: so is our estate far better when we haue few wants, then wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting much to haue many supplies (euen as it is better to be in health without medicines, then to be weake &amp; sickly aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with thē) not only because they bring trouble by their continuall vse, but also being outward things, they are both prouided and kept with care and labor, &amp; though they now abound, yet within a while they may be wanting vnto vs; wheras when we haue few wants, we also need few supplies, which commōly are hard at hand &amp; easily compassed. There is no man but would thinke his estate much better, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing necessarily to go a iorney should need but smal prouision by reason of his strength and health; as bread &amp; water, light clothing, and hard lodging; then another who though he be but weak, yet is forced to cary a whole burthē of necessaries, both for diet, Physicke and apparell: but we are all to trauell in our earthly pilgrimage towards our heauenly countrie; and therefore how much better is their condition, who need fewest necessaries, which are as easily prouided, as lightly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; then theirs who hauing abundance of these earthly things, cannot go without them, nor yet carie them with them without toile and labour; seeing their store may faile, or by force be taken from them, and so leaue them to pine in want and miserie?</p>
               <p>But this will the better appeare, if we consider the speciall<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. The former point shewed by the speciall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, riches and pleasures.</hi>
                  </note> instances: for who seeth not that worldly honors do bring with them many necessities, and cause them who haue them to want innumerable things of which others haue no need? they cannot with their honor go alone in publike places, but must haue a retinue of seruants attending on them; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not visit a friend without horses and coaches, &amp; as one saith, they are so much caried with others legs, that they forget to

So likewise riches &amp; abundance bring to their owners many wants; from which the poorer sort are priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; for according to their store and prouision, accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming themselues to the vse of many things, whereas at first they were meere superfluities, they are now by custome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come necessaries: for example, they haue diuers suits for the seuerall seasons, &amp; wearing that which fitteth the time of the yeere, they accustome their bodies to a iust proportion or temperature betweene heat and cold; so also they carefully obserue the weather, keeping themselues warme within doores when the cold North wind bloweth, and onely wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king abroad when the aire is pleasant, and of a fit temper for their bodies. Finally, they liue at ease, shunning labour and any painfull exercise which might cause wearines, and do all their businesses by the ministery of their seruants. To al which when they haue by long custome inured themselues, they cannot endure any alteration: if they be a little warmer then ordinary, they are impatient of heat, &amp; complaine as if they were broiled; if the cold wind do but blow vpon them, they are readie to shake as if they were starued. If vpon some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occasion they are forced to take any paines, they are presently sicke with wearinesse, and soone after lame and vnable to stir. Neither do they take vpon them these things for the more state, or counterfeit them for wantonnes, or are only subiect to these infirmities through the impatiencie of their minds: but their nicenes, supplied and nourished with their abundance, maketh this tendernes and weaknes so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall to their bodies, that they can in truth endure no hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; nor want any thing vnto which they are accustomed without imminent danger. If vnseasonablie they leaue off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their ordinarie apparell, or stand but a little in the cold ayre, they hazard their health by taking cold; if the weather be but a little too hot, they are ready to faint; if they take a
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:10731:396"/> little extraordinary paines, it is grieuous vnto them, and the absence of their seruants whose ministery they vse, is as trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome vnto the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And therefore seeing riches haue so many infirmities attending on them, &amp; subiect those that haue them to so many wants, from all which the poore estate is priuiledged and exempted; there is no reason why we should dote so vpon them with immoderate loue, and flie the other with such feare and hatred; seeing in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the meane condition hath iust preeminence: for though it be good to haue much, yet it is better to want nothing▪ see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we come neerest to the estate of the blessed Saints &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, not in possessing worldly abundance, but in little nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding such supplies. To which purpose one saith, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer a rich man may seeme great and happie, because he hath horses, costly prouision, seruants and attendance: and though he may seeme to haue great power, because he hath many at command, appointing to euery one their seuerall businesse; yet in truth these words of command, shew ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">

The like also may be said of voluptuous pleasures, which whosoeuer haue in abundance, and set their hearts on them with immoderate loue, they are so farre from being perfected by them, that they adde much to their imperfection. For though at first they were but meere superfluities, yet being by custome inured to them,
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:10731:397"/> they become so necessarie, that they cannot want them without great griefe and discontent. Thus ordinarie drinkes seeme to their taste loathsome medicines, common fare, a tedious fast, want of sports and pastimes, a discomfortable imprisonment, and ordinarie societie, an irkesome solitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; neither doe they seeme to themselues any longer to liue, then they enioy their vsuall delights, sitting downe at full tables furnished with all dainties, enioying the societie of their pleasant companions, and spending the day in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and reuelling; in seeing shewes and playes, and in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their sports and carnall delights: wherein, as one<note place="margin">Senec. epist. 39.</note> saith, they are of all others most miserable, because they are come to that passe, that those things which were superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, are now become necessarie, whereby they become slaues to their delights, not freely enioying, but basely ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them; and that which is the worst of ils, they loue their slaueries; for them our vnhappinesse is compleate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, when as filthie and dishonest things, do not only a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle<note place="margin">

In which respect (as he saith elsewhere) it is the greatest pleasure, not to stand in need of these pleasures, and to be (like the Apostle) free men, who can vse them, and not be brought in subiection vnto them; enioying them with a carelesse contempt, and losing them without griefe: or vsing pleasures, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels vse meate which they can eate for companie, and as easily obserue perpetuall abstinence; their feeding being an action of power, and not of necessitie. Finally, seeing the abundance of these earthly things bringeth want, and the greatest plentie is the cause of the greatest penurie and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, like meates which do not satisfie, but increase the hunger; let vs learne to contemne them, or at least care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessely vse them: and let vs set our hearts on Gods spirituall graces and heauenly ioyes, by whose store we are enriched, and whose plentie brings sufficiencie.

All which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, of the world, they willingly obey, neglecting

And because these are many and their minds and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires variable, yea often contrarie the one to the other; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they may please them al, they are faine to transform themselues into a thousand shapes, and in their words and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, according to the diuersity of their occasions, to vse ten thousand contradictions, humouring euery one in their owne vaine, and like parasites studying to please all others rather then themselues; that so they may at least giue them content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seuerally, vnto whom they meane to bee beholding, whom it is impossible to please all together: which though they can doe with some facility (hauing brought their minds to a seruile subiection, for the more easie obtaining of their desires) when they haue to deale with them single and alone; yet how are they moiled and troubled with cares and feares of losing the fauour of some or all?

So likewise as a seruant, though he haue the care and paines in tending them, yet he hath not the power or courage to touch them, or to dispose of them to those vses which his iudgement best approueth, for feare of displeasing these tyrannous masters, the earthly mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and his carnall concupiscence.

Yea hauing made gold his god, by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, trusting, and hoping in it, hee abstaineth from tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching it, and from imploying it to common vse, as though he feared to commit sacriledge against his Idoll; and can as easily be perswaded to breake his bones as his bags, and to teare off a peece of his flesh, or maime a member, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate any part of his whole summes to charitable vses. Yea as though he had receiued some speciall charge from his Soueraigne, the neglect whereof should be punished with death▪ (euen when himselfe stands in need of necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, wanting either clothes for his backe, or food for his belly) he dare not touch his full bagges; and as if they were not his owne, but the goods of strangers committed to his custody, he dare not diminish them, lest he should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of theft. In which respect the couetous miser is truly<note place="margin">Senec. epist. 119.</note> said to be possessed of riches rather then to possesse them, hauing them as a prisoner hath his keeper, which seemeth to waite and attend vpon him as his seruant; when as in truth he is his iaylor, who will not suffer him to goe any where, but whither hee pleaseth: Or as a man is said to haue an Ague, whereas it rather hath him: or as he is said to haue a chaine who is bound with it, which enthralleth &amp; captiueth him, and whilest he hath it in his keeping, is also kept of it, so as he can neither moue nor stirre, but onely so farre as it giueth him liberty.</p>

And howsoeuer they haue abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in their keeping, yet will they let them haue scarce any thing in vse; and possessing much, they haue nothing in fruition. Wherein they may fitly bee compared to such Wards, who hauing a little too great possessions, die in their wardship, and neuer come to the vse of their lands: or to the Patriarches sacks, which hauing in them both corne and mony, had no further vse of either, but to bee worne out in keeping them. In which respect, the miser and slaue of wealth is said, not to be rich, but, as it were rich, because in his abundance his Idoll and auarice keepe him poore. So the Wise man saith; that <hi>there is that maketh himselfe rich, and</hi>

Now what difference is there betweene wanting it, and thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it, seeing they haue their riches no otherwise then the Phorcides had their eye, which (in a poeticall fiction, mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized by these misers) are saide to haue kept it locked vp in a box, where as they in the meane time going abroad, were ready to fall into the pits and ditches for want of sight,<note place="margin">Stobaeus Ser. 97. Tom. 2.</note> till at last by force it was taken from them. Finally, where as good masters spare their seruants in their old age, letting them take some rest after their painfull labours, and after faithfull seruice performed, make them free men, and set them at liberty: contrariwise, these cruell tyrants neuer fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour their bondslaues, but the more faithfull seruice they haue done them, the more heauy burthens they impose vpon them: neither will they euer suffer them to come out of their apprentiship, and to rest from their drudgery; but euen when they are old and decrepit, and (as it were) haue one foote already in the graue, they still turmoile them with feares and carking cares, and make them to trudge on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie base arrand which promiseth gain, when they cannot go without a staffe. And that which is worst of all, they daily spend and tire them, not only in painfull but also in sinfull seruices, making thē most vnconscionably to lie, dissemble sweare, &amp; forsweare, deceiue with fraud, and oppresse with crueltie, all with whom they deale; and that when they are ready to leaue the world, indangering thēselues in most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate maner to eternal destruction, &amp; that for no further profit in respect of their owne vse, but that they may haue a name to haue left much to their heires and executors. And therefore seeing this worldly wealth immoderately loued, doth bring it owners into this cruell seruitude, let this serue to weane our hearts from this excessiue loue.

They set all aside, which may either concerne their credit or profit, that they may serue their lusts, and cannot so well be said to buy pleasures to please their carnall appetites, as wholly to sell themselues ouer vnto pleasures, not caring to bee their slaues, so they may inioy their company. And thus the glutton is a seruant to his own belly, &amp; the drunkard to his filthy appetite, spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all their time in furnishing and feeding at full tables, and in procuring and drinking delicate wines, and most pleasing drinks. The which masters they serue with such ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile obedience, that the Apostle doubteth not to call them belly-gods, seeing they not onely haue all their seruice both of body and mind, but also performed with all deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And thus also the whoremaster becommeth a slaue, not onely to his filthy lust, which maketh him to neglect all duty to God, his neighbour, and himselfe, and not caring for health, person, nor estate, to runne at the command of his concupiscence into all desperate dangers; but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth a most slauish seruant to his harlot, being wholly at her command, running when she appointeth, comming when she calleth, going away when shee biddeth, giuing when she asketh, and fearing when she threatneth. Neither is this seruitude to worldly pleasures and our owne volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnesse light, or the euils few which they cause vnto vs: for no enemie can be so tyrannous, or bring vpon any so many and greeuous mischiefes, as these carnall pleasures, when once they haue got men into their thraldome and subiection.

And as it is said of <hi>Vlysses</hi> retinue, that hauing drunke those impoisoned cuppes which <hi>Circes</hi> had prepared for them, and being by them transformed into beasts, they were so in loue with their bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish condition, that they would not againe bee transformed into men: so these worldly Epicures, (in whom this is true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moralized) being by this notorious witch of carnall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures infatuated in their vnderstandings, and turned into beasts, are so delighted with this brutish estate, that they cannot be perswaded to leaue their brutishnesse, and to liue as becommeth reasonable men, &amp; much lesse as it beseemeth the calling of Christians. And as it is said of the Torpedo fish, that it is of such a poysonous &amp; venemous nature, that if it but touch the line of him that angleth, the poyson is therby deriued to the rod, and from thence to the hand, whereby he is presently so stupified and benummed that he loseth his strength, and the vse of his l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The which remidilesse bondage of worldly Epicures, one expresseth after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Doest thou (saith he) thinke those freemen, or cleare from diseases, whome pleasures haue barbarously bound and enthralled? why, though they haue not a chaine to tie them, yet their owne luxuriousnesse holdeth them fast in bonds with vnauoidable tenacity; and being fallen into<note place="margin">Hieron. epist. ad aegrotum amicum. Tom. 4.</note> the snares of beastly pleasures, (as the bird catched by the subtlety of the fowler) the more they labour and striue to escape, the more they are entangled and ensnared. So that
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:10731:405"/> if any man would retaine his pretious liberty, hee must carefully auoide the immoderate loue of carnall delights, and euen stop his eares against the bewitching tunes of<note place="margin">Agesilaus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Plut. in Lacon.

And if with importunity a present of voluptuous pleasures be forced vpon vs; let vs with the wise Emperour not keepe them from our selues, &amp; the vse of others, whom we desire to continue in a generous and free disposition: but carelesly cast them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to bee enioyed by such Helots and slaues, as are of a base qualitie and seruile nature, as better beseeming them, then such as professe the glorious liberty of the sonnes of God. Especially, considering that as they take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the freedome of men, so much more the liberty of Christians, making them to become the seruants of sinne, and slaues of sathan; and consequently vtterly vnable to do seruice vnto God: for they who are addicted to voluptuous pleasures, are ready to attain vnto the sinful fruition of thē, by neglecting all good duties which they owe vnto God,<note place="margin">

And therefore to conclude this point, if we would not lose the liberty both of men and Christians, and subiect our selues to a seruile estate, and most slauish condition, let vs not set our hearts vpon, nor immoderately loue these worldly vanities, but vsing them as though wee vsed them not, let vs stand fast in that liberty wherewith Christ hath set vs free, and place our affections vpon the sweete and comfortable graces of Gods holy spirit, and the eternall ioyes of his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kingdome, wherein wee shall bee honoured, enriched,<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 11.

               <p>The fourth euill which abundance of these worldly things bringeth, is, that they expose those that haue them to the enuie and hatred of those who are about them: for su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:10731:405"/> spite at them because they come so neere them, and inferiours enuie them because they are preferred before thē, and equals hate them, because they are matched by them; whereas they ought (as selfeloue maketh them beleeue) to haue had great preheminence: which maligning spite, and fretting enuie continue so long, as they continue in their worldly happinesse; neither is there any meanes to be freed from them, but by losing their prosperitie and becomming miserable. Thus the higher a man is aduanced in honors and<note place="margin">Quò gloria ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior eò propi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidia.</note> preferments, the more commonly he is maligned, and the greater his glorie is, the greater also is his enuie. Yea and that which is worst of all, those often who are honoured with outward complement, as cap and knee only, haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grudges borne them from the very heart, and though they haue but false glorie, yet they haue for it true enuie. The which is more bitter and spitefull, if their ambition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they haue raised themselues vp, haue plainly appeared in their aspiring. For (as one saith) ambition when it breaketh<note place="margin">Bernard. ad E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscop. Aquit. epist. 127.</note> out into impudencie doth lose his efficacie, and when this wicked affection grossely appeareth, it taketh no effect. And therefore ambition being the mother of hypocrisie, doth loue secret corners, and as impatient of the light, it lurketh in darknesse: but when it lieth lowest it looketh highest; like one in the bottome of a well both dark and deepe, who is better inabled hereby to see the highest stars, with a quick and strong sight, then they who stand on the top of a steeple. For the ambitious man knoweth, that if hee haue many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses who are able to giue testimonie of his pride, it is the next way to hinder him of his desired honours, seeing the more glorie is affected, the lesse it is apprehended and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when the affection is discerned: for there is nothing more inglorious, then to aspire vnto glorie. An example whereof we haue in the Apostles <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn:</hi> for howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer<note place="margin">Luke 22. 24. Matth. 20. 21. 24</note> the rest were so ambitious, that there was a great strife amongst them who should be greatest, yet because the aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ambition of these two brethren did more grosly break our in their suit made to our Sauiour, to sit on his right hand, and his left in his kingdome; they hereby exposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:10731:406"/> to the great disdaine of the rest of their fellowes. But howsoeuer this honour attained vnto by ambitious aspiring is most maligned and enuied; yet that glorie and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which commeth either by inheritance or desert, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not his share of enuie and hatred; men being heerein naturally like night bats and owles, who cannot without some impatiencie, and grudging, looke vpon the bright beames of their neighbours glorie, or aduancement. Thus <hi>Caine</hi> could not indure to haue <hi>Abel</hi> preferred before him,<note place="margin">Genes. 4.</note> though he were farre more worthie of preferment. And the Patriarkes pined themselues with enuie, because <hi>Ioseph</hi> was<note place="margin">Gen 37. 4. 11.</note> deseruedly preferred in his fathers loue: &amp; were filled with spite and disdaine, when as he did but dreame of his future honors; which afterwards (they not being able to contain it any longer) did burst out into cruel reuenge. Thus was meek <hi>Moses</hi> enuied and maligned, because God had aduanced<note place="margin">Numb. 16. 3. and 12. 2.</note> him in place of gouernment aboue the rest; and that not only by <hi>Corah,</hi> and his fellow conspiratours; but euen by his owne brother, and sister, <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Miriam,</hi> who were next vnto him. And thus though <hi>Saul,</hi> for his deserts affected, and greatly aduanced <hi>Dauid,</hi> yet when he dimmed his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and in the womens song was preferred before him; <hi>Saul hath slaine his thousand, and Dauid his ten thousand;</hi> hee was<note place="margin">1. Sam. 18. 2. 8.</note> filled with wrath and enuie towards him, and greedily thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted after his blood. The like also may bee said of worldly riches, which when they abound, expose their owners to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie and hatred: and the fatter that men grow in their estates, the leaner the enuious man waxeth when hee looketh on them. An example whereof we haue in <hi>Isaac,</hi> who no sooner was inriched with sheepe and heards of cattell, but presently the Philistims, among whom hee liued, enuied at him. And thus great Landlords are enuied by their poore tenants, whē they behold their large lordships: thus one neighbour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uieth to another his better market, richer soile, and more fruitfull crop; and thus among Merchants he is most spited at by his fellowes, who hath made the most prosperous vioa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and hath with vnexpected speede attained vnto abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of wealth. Finally, howsoeuer a man would think that
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:10731:406"/> worldly pleasures were so base and contemptible, that they were beneath the reach of enuie which looketh vpward, and hath it sight alwaies fixed on high obiects; yet when these carnall delights, which are in their owne nature low, are aduanced and extolled by mens ouer partiall iudgements and opinions, they also presently become the marke of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie; euery one being readie to spite at their neighbours, when they see them wallowing in these earthly pleasures; especially if themselues want necessaries, notwithstanding they tire both bodie and minde with painfull labour. Now the reason why the abundance of worldly benefits is thus accompanied with enuie and hatred, is, because being finite▪ there is but a certaine measure of them; so that the more some abound, the more of necessitie must others want: and into the more parts these earthly things are diuided, the smaller share must euery one haue, to whom they are thus distributed. And therefore men louing and setting their hearts vpon these vanities, do enuie and grudge that others should enioy that which they desire; because their hauing it, is the cause why they want it, or at least why their portion is the lesse, so as they cannot haue it in that quantitie which they could wish; seeing a finite and limited proportion or quantitie, must of necessitie become so much the lesse in the seueral parts, by how much the whole is more often diuided. And therfore seeing worldly prosperitie and the abundance of these earthly things, doe bring as much enuie when wee haue them, as miserie when wee want them; and will scarce counteruaile with their profit and benefit, the discontent which they bring with them through this malignitie and spite, especially when this malice and enuie, being armed with power, is readie continually to make anothers happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse a sufficient cause of quarrell, &amp; to take sharpe reuenge, because they presumed to receiue the worlds proffered fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours; let vs not too much affect these maligned vanities, but wholly set our hearts vpon those heauenly honours, ioyes, and treasures, which being infinite, are not diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when they are communicated to many; but are rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely multiplied and increased by this communion, euerie
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:10731:407"/> one hauing them wholly to himselfe, and by vertue of their perfect loue inioying them wholly in euery one of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low saints and brethren. So that ones fruition of these glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ioyes, is so farre from procuring anothers want, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie vnto themselues; that the more they are in number, the more their ioyes are multiplied; for the more they loue, the more their ioyes are increased, and the more they are increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by this communion, the more they loue.</p>
               <p>The fifth euill accompanying these earthly things, is, that<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 12. That worldly things are the causes of all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</hi>
                  </note> as they procure secret enuie, so also they are the common causes of open emnitie, discord and contention; and that not only betweene strangers, but euen the dearest friends, and neerest kinred; brother falling out with brother, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the childe, when this bone of worldly vanities, as the matter of contention, is cast amongst them. So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Iames</hi> saith, that warres, contentions, and bitter enuying<note place="margin">Iames 4. 1.</note> one another, proceed from these carnall lusts, which fight in the members of greedie worldlings, whereby one coueteth that which another enioyeth, and are filled with enuie and indignation, when they faile of their desire. For when men haue set their hearts on these earthly trifles, and haue made them their idols, louing them more dearely then <hi>Ionathan Dauid,</hi> yea then the saluation of their owne soules; then all inferiour loues must needs giue place, and when they crosse the other are turned into spite and hatred. And from hence it commeth that worldlings are readie to lose their friends, for the getting of these worldly vanities, to neglect all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they owe to kinred and acquaintance, when they hinder their hopes, and will not stand with their carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires; to circumuent them by fraud and deceit, and to offer wrongs and iniuries, iniustice, and all kinde of oppression, that they may by diminishing their estate increase their owne, and seaze into their hands as a prey those things which they thus dearely loue. Which when the other, who affect them as much as they, doe once discerne and perceiue, they become mortall foes, burning in hatred and desire of reuenge, and defending their owne with all their power, as much now for hatred of them who would rob them of their
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:10731:407"/> iewels, as for the loue which they beare to these things themselues. As then this loue of earthly things, doth take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that communitie, which should be among friends; whilest euery one desireth to haue a proprietie in the things which he affecteth, both in respect of their possession, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of their fruition and vse; so doe they with eagernes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to this loue, defend this proprietie; and because their right is sometime ambiguous, and doubtfull in it selfe, and sometime in their opinion only (selfeloue casting a vaile before their eyes); they fall into emnitie and contention, both challenging a right and propriety vnto the things they<note place="margin">

Which contentions and vnfriendly brawles can no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise be auoided, then either by not hauing, or immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly louing the matter or occasion of their discord. Thus honours are the causes of emnity amongst men, whilest they striue who shall haue them, or detract from one anothers praise, or do not giue expected commendations; or are ready to supplant their best respected friends when they stand in their way, and hinder their rising; not sticking to vse al fraud and deceit, lying and dissembling, nor to commit any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, wronging and oppressing, killing and destroying, those who being ouerthrowne, may inrich them with their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious spoyles; or doe by their standing against them keepe them back from enioying their ambitious desires. Wherein they make no difference of friendship or kinred; for if once they be possessed and haunted with this proud furie, they are readie to make warre against their owne brethren, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw their familie, and professe open emnitie against their owne fathers, if they doe but stop them in their eager pursuit<note place="margin">

So also what so great cause is there of emnitie and contention, as worldly riches? which being immoderatly loued, do cause men to offer any wrong or iniurie vnto their neighbours, which may further them to the fruition of that which they so much affect. For whilest all desire to haue them in abundance, and in respect of their limitted quantitie they must of necessitie be but in the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of a few, hence it is that they continually striue and contend, who shall haue the preheminence of seazing vpon,

Neither is there any thing more common then this, among couetous worldlings; vnto whom riches is the fuell of their conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which being set a fire with their burning concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, flame out into wrath and emnitie. So that (as one saith) if they had not iust men among them, which whilest they striue to make peace &amp; part these contending theeues, doe become a bootie vnto them both, they would deuoure one another with their eager contentions; like famished<note place="margin">Chrysost. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. ad Eph. 4. Homil. 9. tom. 4</note> wilde beasts, which with mortall furie would, when hunger pincheth them, fight with those of their owne kinde, that after the conquest they might prey vpon them, if there were not some harmelesse lambes neere vnto them, which part this strife, by becomming a more easie prey vnto them both. And as this is to be daily obserued amongst ordinary neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, so no where more commonly then amongst most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate friends, and neerest kinred, where by reason of their intercourse of dealing, or occasion of diuiding their conioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned right, euery one being to haue that portion which their predecessours left them, there are vsually the most hot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and most implacable emnitie. Yea this strife and discord is not only caused whilest men labour to robbe one another of their right, but euen when they prouide for them in abundance, and only for a time keepe them back from the enioying these rich possessions, which they so eagerly couet. In which respect it may be truly said, that he who gathereth much, maketh his heire his enemie; it being a sufficient quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell and cause of emnitie, that hee liueth ouer long, so as hee cannot vulture-like prey vpon him; and the greater his gaine shall be after his predecessours death, the greater is his
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:10731:408"/> griefe because hee is not dead already; and the greater his ioy when he is departed. Neither is this onely to bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued amongst worldlings, but euen among Gods faithfull seruants, who as they are the more corrupted with the loue of riches, so are they more apt vpon their occasion, to raise sutes and contentions one against another; as we may see in the example of the Corinthians, who for this corruption are<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> reproued by the Apostle. The like may be said of voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pleasures, which being immoderately loued are the common causes of emnitie and dissension, when as one man encrocheth vpon anothers delights, and vseth any meanes to restraine him from these pleasures, which hee so fondly affecteth, that he is ready in a mortall quarrell to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his life, rather then to bee depriued of that which his soule so entirely loueth. And therefore seeing these worldly things, which in themselues are scarce worth the desiring, are the common causes of so much iarring discord, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable emnitie, let vs not set our hearts vpon them, but vpon Gods spirituall graces, which the more they abound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, the more also is their loue and peace increased; and on the heauenly ioyes of Gods kingdome, wherewith all being fully satisfied, there can bee no cause of emnitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them: yea because euery one shall haue so much, that he can hold no more; and yet through the perfection of our loue shall enioy the happinesse of all others; therefore the more they haue, the more wee shall loue them, being (as it were) the rich treasuries of our ioyes, and the meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are infinitely multiplied by communication; wheras they vnto which we haue a propriety, are so great in respect of vs who are full of them, that they doe not admit of any increase.</p>

For who in the time of peace are so much endangered to the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie and falshood of sycophants and slanderers, as they whose prosperity maketh them a fit prey to bee seazed on? for whereas they neuer regard those who are of meane qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as being the obiect rather of pitie, then of enuy, and can with their spoile bring no profit; they bend all their forces against those who are in a prosperous estate, making them guiltie, because they are rich, and thinking it a sufficient quarrell against their peace and safety, because they haue somthing in their possession which they desire to seaze vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they being ready to seeke their destruction not so much for hatred to their persons, as for loue to their riches, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures or preferments, that they may out of their ruine raise their owne estate.

And as the skilfull archer doth not make choice of the least and dimmest marke (or though hee should, were not like to hit it) but of that which is fairest and brightest, because it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to inuite the eye, and to giue vnto him some hope of hitting: and as the cunning markeman letteth passe the ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call deere, and leuelleth his killing arrow at the fattest in the heard; so the more flourishing a mans estate is, and the more goodly shew he maketh in the eies of men, the fairer marke he is for mischiefe to shoot at, and the likelier he is to be hit, and deadly wounded with the piercing arrowes of armed enuie and powerfull malice; seeing like the glowworme he is readie in the night of danger to discouer himselfe with his owne remarkeable brightnesse, so as hee cannot flie the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer, but lighteth as it were a candle for the destroyer to find him.

<pb n="749" facs="tcp:10731:411"/> clog to hinder their flight, and a strong motiue to cause their enemies to pursue them with greater eagernesse. And as the ship heauily laden with rich wares doth allure the pyrate to haue it in chase, and is hindered also with her heauie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then from making away from her cruell pursuer, so that it is impossible to escape; whereas another which hath no other waight but her owne ballaist, saileth by swiftly and securely, hauing nothing in her to intice a robber; not giuing him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hope of fetching her in with his best speed: so hee who hath little fleeth in time of danger cheerefully and securely, hauing neither these golden clogs to burthen his body; nor care and griefe to oppresse his mind; so as hee neither gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnder his beloued load, nor greeueth for that which he hath left behind him: whereas he who hath worldly abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is troubled with al these impediments; being turmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with his cariages, and sorrowing for that which he could not carrie, and equally caring for that which hee hath lost, and for that which he still hath; which though it be so much that it bringeth toile to his body, and trouble to his mind,<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Luc. 16. de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaro conc. 1. &amp; in Hebraeos cap. 10. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 19.</note> yet nothing grieueth him so much, as that he hath not more cause of toile and trouble.

                  </note> mischiefes vsuall accompany these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, especially when they are exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely esteemed and immoderately loued. Now we are to treate of those spiritual euils which they bring with them, the which are either temporall, in this life, or eternall in the life to come. Concerning the former, we are to know, that if we
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:10731:412"/> set our hearts on these vanities, the gaine and accesse of them will not so much adde to our outward estate, as they detract from the riches of our soules; neither will the carnall good they bring, in any proportion counteruaile the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all harmes which attend vpon them. For first, they choake the seed of the Word, and make it vnfruitfull, from which alone the gifts and graces of Gods Spirit spring. In which respect our Sauiour calleth riches thornes, which filling mens minds with worldly cares (as it were with so many prickles and sharpe points) do choake this seed as soone as it springeth vp; and such thornes also are honors and worldly pleasures, when mens affections are set vpon them. For thus are they to vs of a thornie qualitie and nature, whilest they catch and hold vs fast in worldly imployments, so as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not frequent the assemblies of the Saints to heare the word<note place="margin">Matth. 22.</note> of God, but when we are inuited to this heauenly banquet, we are readie to pretend excuses, like those who were called to the Kings supper: or else whilest being come within hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, they make vs with encombred <hi>Martha</hi> to neglect the<note place="margin">Luke 10. 41. 42.</note> word, and to embrace the world; and to stop our eares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all admonitions; as the Lord complaineth of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Iewes. <hi>I spake</hi> (saith he) <hi>vnto thee when thou wast in</hi>

                  <hi>prosperitie, but thou saidest I will not heare, this hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou wouldest not obey my voice.</hi> So although the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> was an eloquent and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full teacher of Gods word, so that the people had no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to take against him, why they should not come to heare him; yet this immoderate loue of riches made their comming altogether vnprofitable. For so the Lord telleth him, that the people resorted vnto him, after the accustomed manner, <hi>and did sit before him, and heare his words, but they</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 33. 31.</note>
                  <hi>would not do them; for with their mouthes they made iests, and their heart did go after their couetousnesse.</hi> Neither do they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distract mens minds in hearing, so as they cannot attend vnto that which is spoken, but if in a deuouter fit they haue receiued any profitable instruction, they presently choake it, and make it to be quite forgotten before it can be brought to any vse or practise: yea if the heart be strongly infected
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:10731:413"/> with the poyson of worldly couetousnes, it will make men not only to neglect, but euen to scorne those profitable admonitions which are deliuered in the ministerie of the word, for the reforming of this and other vices: as we may see in the example of the Scribes and Pharisies, who mocked and derided our Sauiour Christ, when he perswaded them to<note place="margin">Luke 16. 14.</note> the workes of mercie, and that they should not do seruice to the earthly Mammon.</p>
               <p>And as they do choake in vs the seed of the Word, and<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. That abundance of worldly things impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish vs in Gods spiritual graces.</hi>
                  </note> make it vnfruitfull; so do they consequently rob and spoile vs of all the sanctifying gifts, and sauing graces, of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, if once we ouerualue and set our heart vpon them: as for example, honors ambitiously affected and immoderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loued, do keepe all sauing graces from entring into ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And as a vessell cannot be filled with wholesome oyle or sweet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but presently the ayre is driuen out and giueth place: so the hart of man cannot be filled with the precious oyntment of sanctifying grace, till the wind of vaine glorie be expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. To which purpose one saith, that as vaine glorie is the<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Gen. 1. Hom. 5.</note> cause of many euils▪ so especially of this, that it emptieth the soule of all spirituall riches, and depriueth vs of the profit which we might take by them. As therefore the immoderate loue of worldly honors doth swell the hearts of those that haue them with pride and vaine glorie; so these dropsie and corrupt humors, being once receiued, do presently coole and drowne the vitall heate of Gods Spirit, and so disable both soule and bodie in all liuely and spirituall operations, that they cannot performe the workes of godlines. So that fulnes of pride argueth emptines of grace; and where there is much vaine glorie, there certainly is little goodnes; for as addle egges flote aloft, when the other which are good sincke to the bottome; and as the emptiest vessell giues the greatest

Thus also riches too much affected, become (as<note place="margin">Luke 8. 14.</note> our Sauiour Christ hath taught vs) thornes which will let no graces grow in vs, and come to ripenes; and therefore the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> telleth vs, that we must flie couetousnes, before we can follow <hi>after righteousnes, godlines, faith, loue, patience,</hi>

The like also may be said of voluptuous pleasures; for as the heathen man could truly say, the tree of vertue cannot grow in the land of pleasures; because they who are addicted to carnall delights are made so pursie and short winded, that they cannot take the paines to ascend the hill of vertue; neither in truth haue they any desire; for they<note place="margin">Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>and seeke not the honor which commeth of God alone?</hi> And the same effect hath the immoderate loue of riches; for as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle teacheth vs, they <hi>who lusted after money erred from the</hi>

Iohn 2. 15.</note> if any man loue the world, the loue of the Father dwelleth not in him: yea this loue of the world is emnitie with God, as the Apostle teacheth vs. Now they who loue not God do<note place="margin">Iames 4 4.</note> not trust, nor hope in him; neither yet performe any other dutie, seeing loue is the fountaine of all true obedience. And therefore we must emptie our hearts of this worldly loue, if we would haue any sanctifying graces to dwell in them; we must learne to contemne these earthly vanities, before wee can esteeme, or with any desire seek after faith, affiance, hope, loue, or any other sauing grace of Gods holy spirit; for the oile of Gods graces, and these waterish vanities wil not mixe together.</p>

For who seeth not, that commonlie they are most foolish, vpon whom the world most fawneth? and that it is the lot of very few in this life to be happie and wise? For as those who are cockred by their parents, become foolish with wantonnesse; so when men grow wanton with ouermuch worldly felicity, they are so besotted with follie, that they neither know themselues, nor other men. And as those who haue walked in the snow, and haue had the bright beames of the Sunne shining in their eies, are made hereby corporally blind; so those who haue had these bright obiects of prosperitie alwaies in their sight, are blinded spiritually in their minds and vnderstandings; for as though these were contrary betweene themselues, and to vs incompetible, to haue a great estate, and a good vnderstanding; so much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sighted we are in time of aduersitie, then in prosperitie. But as this confluence of worldly benefits makes men dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted in ciuill wisdome, so stark blind in the waies of God. And therefore the Psalmist ioyneth both these together,<note place="margin">Psalm. 10. 5.</note> worldly prosperitie, and ignorance of Gods will: <hi>his waies</hi> (saith he) <hi>alwaies prosper, and Gods iudgements are high abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="755" facs="tcp:10731:414"/> blindeth the eies of worldlings, doth call him in that place, the <hi>God of the world;</hi> implying thereby, that he vseth the world, and worldly vanities, as his instruments for the smiting of them with this spirituall blindnesse. <hi>In whom</hi> (saith<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 4.</note> he) <hi>the God of this world hath blinded the minds, that is, of the Infidels, that the light of the glorious Gospell of Christ, which is the image of God, should not shine vnto them.</hi> For Satan casteth this dust of worldly vanities, into the eies of carnal men, that<note place="margin">Naziaoz. de bominis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate.</note> they may not discerne the shining beames of Gods truth; but may grope at noone day, and for want of this spirituall light to guide them, may erre out of the right way, which leadeth to glory and eternall happinesse, and goe the broad and plaine way which leadeth to destruction. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, these worldly things may fitly be compared to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant wines, which being drunke in abundance, so intoxicate the braine, that there is for the time, no difference betweene drunkards, and fooles, or madmen: for so they who abound in all earthly prosperitie, haue their vnderstandings infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and their senses besotted with much drinking of these golden cups, so as they haue no more wisdome or iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to discerne of spirituall things, then very fooles or fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke persons. For as mad men doe not see things as they are in truth, but as their lunasie and disease doth offer them to their deluded phantasie; so neither doe they who go a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding after worldly vanities, vnderstand and iudge of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and spirituall things, as they are in their owne nature, and according to their true worth and value, but are wholly led with their disease, iudging neither according to religion, nor yet well grounded reason, but as they are deluded and misguided with their carnal concupiscence. And that world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are in truth thus mad and foolish, and wholly blinded with the things whereupon they haue set their hearts, it may clearely appeare, if wee consider their whole course and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. For who but fooles and mad men would lay vp their treasures there, where they haue no certaintie to continue one houre, and where all their predecessours hauing stored vp all their riches haue been robbed of them; not placing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of them in their owne countrie, where they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine

The like also may be said of riches, which being immoderatly loued, doe so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuate the minde of the couetous man, that hee hath wit for nothing, but to gather wealth; and like the blinde moale he knoweth only to dig in the earth, and to hunt after his prey, and is starke blind in the waies of God, and in discerning the bright shining light of his truth. Yea when once this cloud of couetousnesse hath darkened, and as it were cast a thick foggy mist of ignorance, before the eyes of his soule, he is so blind that hee can put no difference betweene friend and foe, kinred and stranger, good and euill, right &amp; wrong, the seruice of God, and the seruice of the diuell, but is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to make vse of all persons, and of all courses whatsoeuer, so farre foorth only as they may serue as his instruments, for the gathering or increasing of his wealth. And as those who are in the darke can put no difference betweene pretious stones and worthlesse peebles, copper and gold, the most orient colour, and a duskish russet; so they who haue their vnderstandings darkned with couetousnes, are ready in their blinded iudgements, to preferre the world before God, the earth before heauen, and things temporarie before things eternall, because they are subiect to their grosse senses, and may be palpably felt, and euen groped out in this night of their ignorance. In a word, according to the measure of his gaine which hee may make by any thing, such is his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, such also is the proportion of his loue. He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and taketh acquaintance of his friends when they may profit him; but if they are like to bee his hindrance, he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth by and cannot see them, or seeing know them. If a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will aduance his gaine, hee esteemeth him aboue a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or a father; yea if an enemie will helpe to increase his riches, he shall be reputed his dearest friend. If he can make
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:10731:417"/> any profit by religion, he will take acquaintance of it, and no man in outward shew shall be more deuout; but if it will not stand with his worldly aduantage, he will with <hi>Demas,</hi> forsake it, and with <hi>Demetrius</hi> persecute it. Finally, nothing more then voluptuous pleasures do infatuate the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and blind the eyes of the soule, so as they are not able to iudge and determine any thing according to reason, but measure all things by brutish sensualitie.

And thus the ambitious man being aduanced vnto honours and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, can neuer haue a true sight and knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; partly because his owne pride and selfeloue blindeth him, so as hee can neuer make a true estimate of his owne worth, and partly because he hath a whole cloud of parasites and flatterers about him, which dazle his sight, and with ouer partiall praises extoll his good parts, and magnifie his gifts farre aboue their true value; so as he can neuer see them as they are in truth, but as these false glasses offer them to his view.

<pb n="763" facs="tcp:10731:418"/> when he is base; highly in Gods loue, when he is deepely in his displeasure; and better then a man, when he is worse then a diuell? seeing if a man know not his humane frailtie, he will neuer seeke after spirituall perfection; if he do not see his beggerie, he will neuer labour after true riches; if he feele not his sicknes, he will neuer seeke to haue it cured; and if he do not discerne his worldly miserie, he will neuer hunger af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heauenly happinesse.</p>

And as flies forsake the kitching being swept and clensed, and waspes the hony pot when it is emptie and cleane washed, about which they swarmed in great multitudes, whilest being full they might sucke from it any sweetnes: so these false friends haunt and flocke vnto the houses of the rich, whilest their store lasteth; but if by any casualtie they be stripped of their wealth, presently their friendship faileth when the cause thereof is taken away.

And howsoeuer it bee not altogether impossible for those who flourish in worldly prosperity, to repent of their sinnes; yet it is a worke of exceeding great difficulty, and quite against nature, that worldly ioy and godly sorrow should dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

For howsoeuer when their sweet sinnes haue an after tast of bitter punishment, they may by sense of paine bee moued to dislike and loath them; yet when they prosper in their wickednesse, and doe not onely take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in the sinne it selfe, which is most delightfull to their carnall appetite, but also find the fruites thereof alike sweet and pleasant, growing great by their ambition, waxing rich

In which respect there cannot bee a more fearefull iudgement of God vpon sinfull man, then when sinne hauing gone before, he suffereth prosperity to follow after, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because hauing (as they take it) their wickednesse richly rewarded, they are ready to thinke (as the Psalmist speaketh) that God is like vnto them; or at least that hee can bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to winke at their wicked courses, and is not displeased with their sinnes; but also because thriuing in their vices and euill waies, they are ready to attribute this prosperitie vnto their wickednesse, as though it were the cause thereof: as we may see in the example of the Iewes, who imagined that all<note place="margin">Ier. 44. 17.</note> their plentie and prosperity was the fruit of their idolatrie, because they left the Lord, and worshipped the queene of heauen. The which maketh them so to loue their sinnes, that it is a matter of great difficultie to persuade them so much as to haue an hard conceit of them, much more to bee willing to leaue and forsake them, seeing they haue by them no small aduantage, as <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Yea when by Gods messengers they are called to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, they doe dot onely turne away their eare, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den their hearts, giuing no credit to their admonitions and threatnings; but they also are ready to deride and skorne them for their labours, as the Scribes and Pharisies did our Sauiour Christ when he sought to reforme them of their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse.<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 14.</note> Finally, if their consciences bee conuinced of sinne in the ministerie of the word; or if in the middest of their prosperity, they haue some rubbes of affliction cast in their way, and so comming to the knowledge that they are spiritually diseased, they are troubled and afflicted in their minds, and haue some motions to repentance, and some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to bee cured of their sicknesses and sores; yet they are presently againe caried away with the world, and hindred from going vnto the physition of soules, by vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and amendment; but in the pride and security of their hearts, wholly trust to their owne remedies, seeking to put off these qualmes of conscience, by frequenting of merrie companie, hearing delightfull musicke, eating and drinking with their boone-companions, and following their sports and recreations; whereby the desperatenesse of their estate appeareth, in that they haue no other meanes to giue them ease, but by applying one disease for the cure of another, and by making a medicine of a maledie. And thus it appeareth
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:10731:423"/> that the more men flourish in prosperitie, the further they are from true repentance; and that when being wedded vnto their sinnes, they haue also receiued the dowrie of earthly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, there can nothing but death diuorce and separate them; because as they loue their vices and corruptions, so they hate and skorne al meanes, whereby they may be cured. Which if it be not cleare enough by the reasons before allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, let men but looke into the courts of Princes, and such places as most abound in all prosperitie, where sinne is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and the meanes of repentance despised, so as they will not heare Gods iudgements against wickednesse at all, that they may lay them to heart, and be reformed; or if they bee present when they are denounced, cannot heare them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disdaine or skorning; and so may they easily bee confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in this truth by their owne experience.</p>

Now what enemy could shew a more notable fruit of hatred, then to intice them by alluring perswasions to seeke the world, and lose their soule, to prefer earthly prosperitie before hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly glorie, and the temporarie fruition of these momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie trifles, before the Kingdome of God, and eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes?

And yet for all this, in truth their loue towards their bodies, is but false and counterfeit; for, for the present, they oftentimes weakē it with pampering, and kill it with cockring; or contrariwise, when they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with worldly loue in more violent courses, they pine and consume it with watchings, cares, feares and sorrowes, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and tire it with toilesome labours; and continually ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard it to desperate dangers both by sea and land, that they may obtaine these earthly things, which they loue better then either bodie or soule. And finally, when by all this care and paines, they haue gotten them into their possession, they will rather pinch both backe and bellie, then they will spend and diminish that, which their soule so dearely loueth. And if we respect the time to come, who can imagine that he who too much loueth the world, doth at all loue either bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die or soule? seeing he taketh a wilfull course of sinne for the obtaining of his earthly desires, whereby he casteth them both, as it were, headlong into hell; the one to bee tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in vnquenchable flames, the other to be pursued with a heauier punishment, the fierce and implacable wrath of God. And therefore it may be truly said, that he who loueth the world hateth himselfe; seeing if he haue any loue at all, it is false and counterfeit, and he who falsely loueth, truly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth; because the fruits thereof are no lesse hurtfull and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, then those which proceed from the cruell malice of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So that if there bee not in great persons a great and extraordinarie reformation, they doe in climing vp to these high places, and continuing still in their vices and sinnes, but (like Apes on the tops of houses) draw men the more readily to looke vpon them, and looking to behold their nakednes and filthinesse. And as the greatnesse of the base doth make the image vpon it to seeme so much the lesse; so the greatnesse of mens places doth but the more extenuate their worth, and shew the great disproportion, betweene their aduancement and desert.

In which respect, it may be truly said, that as the loue of God is the fountaine of al true obedience, so the loue of the world is the chiefe, and almost only motiue vnto all sinne, and consequently the onely meanes which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath to draw men from God, and to hold them in his miserable bondage and subiection. For who would renounce the seruice of God, and serue the diuell, if it were not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this wages of iniquitie? who in the spirituall conflict, would leaue the standard of the Lord of hosts, who being omnipotent in power, is sure in the end to haue the victorie, and hath promised to all his souldiers no lesse then crownes and kingdomes; were it not that Satan allureth and hireth them to fight on his side, with the present pay of worldly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, pleasures, and preferments? Who by sinning would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his soule to eternall torments, if hee were not allured with these inticing baits of earthly vanities? Who would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine sinne, if it should come alone, and appeare in it owne vgly and monstrous shape, though now they willingly giue it the best welcome, and lodge it in their hearts, because it commeth disguised, and (as it were) guilded ouer with this worldly beautie? Who would bee at Satans absolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to doe his will, without hope of any reward; though
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:10731:425"/> now they willingly hearken, when he saith, <hi>All this wil I giue thee</hi> if thou wilt doe me seruice? Would we therefore know wherein Satans power chiefly consisteth, whereby hee van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisheth such great multitudes, and raigneth and ruleth as the prince of the world in the hearts of vnbeleeuers? Surely it is not so much in his owne strength, as in these worldly aides. For his power and malice is so limited by God, that he cannot ouercome by force and violence any, who haue but so much as a desire to make resistance; and hee is onely permitted to get the victorie ouer those, who are willing to be ouercome, and to leade them alone into his seruitude and subiection, whom hee can perswade to acknowledge him as their lord and master. And therefore hee seldome bringeth his forces against vs into the open field, or attempteth to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome vs by force and violence; but he seeketh treacherou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slie to betray vs, by perswading vs to a parley, wherein hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth these worldly vanities, as his eloquent and most preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling orators, to allure vs to leaue the Lord, and to listen vnto him, seeing he perswadeth vs to nothing, but that which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to our present profit, and which is most pleasing to our naturall appetites. He will make vs beleeue, that the sinne is but small, and the reward great; and say vnto vs, as <hi>Bethshabe</hi>

He will offer vs honours, and promise that we shall be highly aduanced aboue other men; but we must first by sinne bow vnto him, and doe him reuerence: he will promise vs riches, but vpon the condition that we be content to vse fraude, and deceit, oppression and crueltie, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing of them. He will tender vnto vs varietie of delights; but if we will haue them, we must to inioy them, neglect the seruice of God, and vse them immoderately and in excesse. Vnto which perswasions, we are too too readie to listen and yeeld, not simply, because Satan requireth it, but because wee dote on the loue of these worldly things which he offereth vnto vs. These then are that treble cord of vanitie, whereby the diuell draweth men into all iniquitie; these are the sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
<pb n="777" facs="tcp:10731:425"/> of this hellish Vulcan; whereupon he hammereth and forgeth his chaines of tentations, wherewith hee draweth men into the pit of perdition, and his mortall darts, with which he woundeth them to eternall death. These are the nailes wherewith he fastneth the hearts of carnall men to the earth, so as they can neuer lift them vp in any heauenly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.

These are the woods and bushes, wherein Satan laieth his secret ambushments, that he may suddenly assault vs and ouercome vs at vnawares, whom he could not vanquish in a pitched battell; and the bootie<note place="margin">Basil. in tract. de rebus secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</note> which he inticeth vs to prey vpon to our destruction. In a word, as these worldly things are the tempters chief induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perswade vs vnto sinne; so are they the instruments and meanes of wickednesse, when wee are inticed to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine these euill motions. For by the helpe of these, prodigals<note place="margin">Luke 15. 13. 30. 1.

All which happeneth not out of the nature of the things themselues (as before I haue shewed) but through the corruption of those who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them, doe abuse them, both as occasions and meanes, inducements vnto, and helpes and furtherances of their wicked courses.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Deut. 7. 25. Ambros. lib. de bono mortis, cap. 5. tom. 4.</note>
                  <hi>snared therewith.</hi> To which purpose one saith, that there is a snare in gold, birdlime in siluer, intangling nets and grins in lands and lordships: and therefore, that if wee too greedily couer gold, wee shall be▪ strangled and choaked; if wee too eagerly seeke siluer, we shall be catched in this lime; if wee
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:10731:426"/> couetously seaze vpon these large lordships, wee shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled and insnared. And another exhorteth vs by al means to flee the immoderate loue of gold, as being a flattering<note place="margin">Basil. epist. ad Chilonem.</note> traitor to our soules, the parent of sinne, and the diuels depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to draw vs on into all wickednesse. Yea so deceitfull are these snares that few escape them; and so strong they are to hold all whom they catch, that few who are once intangled in them, can euer get freedome and deliuerance. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> maketh it one of the wonders of the world, to finde a man perfect in this triall: <hi>Who</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath been tried thereby, and found perfect? let him be an example of</hi>

                  <hi>glorie,</hi> &amp;c. So that Satan, the great enemie of our saluation, hath not much adoe to vanquish and leade captiue vnto all maner of sin, those who set their hearts vpon these worldly riches, seeing to get the prey, they are readie of themselues without his instigation, to runne willingly into these snares, and with all speede to preuent one another in catching of these baits, euen when the hooke of sinne lying hid in them, is readie to choake them; striuing who shall doe most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent seruice to the prince of darknesse, when he offereth for their reward the rich wages of worldly wealth. Yea and whē they finde themselues catched in these nets of perdition, by feeding on this pleasing baite, so farre are they from desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and vsing the meanes of their deliuerance, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in their snares, and desire more and more to be intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as though they thought it a thraldome to be set at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the greatest freedome to be so inthralled. For who seeth not by daily experience, that couetous men, like fish<note place="margin">Auarus ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam lucretur, lucro obijcitur; antequam capia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur captus est.</note> about the baited hooke, striue who shall catch the choaking prey, not caring to bee taken, so they may take it; to lose themselues, for worldly gaine; and whilest they may prey on this baite of wealth, to make their soules a prey to that hellish fisher, who seeketh to catch them on the hooke of perdition? Who seeth not that for the getting of wealth they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to omit all duties to God and man; to neglect friends and kinred, to lie, dissemble, defraud, oppresse, and what not, that by spoiling others, they may increase their owne stock? And as Satan now preuaileth by the helpe of this golden bait
<pb n="780" facs="tcp:10731:427"/> in catching of innumerable soules in the snares of sinhe, so hath he euer done in former times; for herewith he allured <hi>Achan</hi> to theft, <hi>Gehezie</hi> to take the vntimely bribe, to Gods dishonor, and his masters discredit; <hi>Achab</hi> to murther and oppression; <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> to lie vnto the holy Ghost, <hi>Demas</hi> to embrace the world, and leaue Christ, and <hi>Iudas</hi> to betray his Lord and Master, and together with him his owne soule. Euen as in our owne daies by the same meanes he allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Magistrates to receiue bribes, and peruert iustice; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to make simoniacall contracts, and to multiplie their liuings, taking all the care for the fleece, and nothing for the flocke; Lawyers to plead in bad causes, and to oppose the good; Officers to play the extortioners; Land-lords to vse cruelty and oppression; and Citizens to rob their neighbours by fraud and deceit. And that which is most lamentable, he doth insnare in sinne with this bait of riches, not worldlings only, who make a god of gaine, but euen professors of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, who are readie oftentimes to straine their consciences, and (as it were) to set them vpon the racke, for the inriching of themselues with this Mammon of iniquitie.</p>
               <p>Finally, worldly pleasures immoderately loued, become<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 15. That pleasures immoderately loued become tentations and snares.</hi>
                  </note> tentations and snares to intangle vs in sinne, and those sweet potions which with their pleasing delight allure vs to drinke with them the deadly poyson of impietie and wickednesse. With this inticing bait Satan perswaded our first parents to eate the forbidden fruit, because it was beautifull to the eye: herewith he allured the sonnes of God to match in marriage with the daughters of men, when they saw that they were faire to looke vpon: with it hee inticed <hi>Lot</hi> to ioyne in neighbourhood with the wicked Sodomites, because their countrey was pleasant and delightfull, and afterwards to commit those grieuous sinnes of drunkennesse and incest: with this bait of pleasure he drew the people of Sodom and Gomorrah to vnnaturall filthines, and to fall into all manner of abominations: with it he inticed the Israelites to commit<note place="margin">Gen. 14. 10. 11.</note> whoredome with the Midianitish women; <hi>Dauid</hi> to adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie and murther, and <hi>Salomon</hi> to fornication both corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and spirituall. And this is that bewitching allurement,
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:10731:427"/> whereby the diuell so much preuaileth euen in these daires, by causing men to fall in this spirituall fight into these lime pits of carnall pleasures, and so obtaining an easie victorie, he leadeth them away captiue into all manner of sinue, as chambring and wantonnesse, lust and vncleanenesse, surfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">Prou. 7. 16. 17.</note> and drunkennesse, and whatsoeuer other wickednesse may further them either in the procuring, or enioying of their carnall delights: with all which the flesh being fed and pampered, becommeth a strong assistant vnto Satan in assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the spirituall man, and in leading him captiue vnto sin: whereby the folly of worldlings clearely appeareth, in that they willingly nourish this secret traytor, and strengthen this enemie against themselues, taking all their care in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and their comfort in enioying that, which inthralleth them in the bondage of sinne, and both furthereth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth their fearefull condemnation: as though the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked flesh were not a soile fertile enough to nourish and bring forth the fruits of wickednesse, vnlesse it were made more rancke with this dung of worldly vanities. And thus haue I shewed that these earthly things, honors, riches and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures being immoderately loued and desired, doe become the diuels baits and snares to intangle vs in sinne to our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and destruction: whereby it appeareth how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and desperate the state of worldlings is, who are on all sides beset with nets, which that deadly fowler Satan doth continually watch, and (as <hi>Bildad</hi> speaketh) <hi>do walke in the</hi>

But this wil yet more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare, if we further consider the speciall instances, and
<pb n="784" facs="tcp:10731:429"/> first these worldly honors when they are excessiuely loued and ouer-greedily desired, do by our wicked getting, and proud keeping them, expose vs to Gods wrath and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in the day of his visitation: for hard and almost impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible it is, to the corrupt nature of man to be aduanced to high places and great dignities, and not to be proud of his preferment; hard it is to be magnified among the people, and not also too much to magnifie a mans owne worth, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerweene his gifts and good parts: hard it is for a man to be great and glorious vpon earth, and to keepe a due remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him from whom he hath receiued his glorie and greatnes. And contrariwise, through the same corruption of our nature, those who are aduanced to honorable places are apt to be puffed vp in pride, to forget the Lord who hath preferred them, to rob him of his glorie, and to arrogate the praise of their preferments to themselues, their owne poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and good parts which is due and peculiar to God alone, by reason of which abuse they commonly make God their enemie, and inflame his wrath against them, for their sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious impietie; and the more gloriously they shine before men, the more their honor is obscured in the sight of God; the more they magnifie and extoll themselues, the more doth he vilifie and contemne them; yea he doth not only despise them in their greatest pride as abiects, but opposeth against them as enemies, and as his corriuals in that which is most deare vnto him, his honor and glory; as though he should say; To me belongeth this combate against the proud, with mine owne hand must mine owne title be tried, and glory defended; this man encroching vpon my right, challengeth me to the fight, as my speciall aduersarie and enemie, and therefore I wil take mine owne cause into mine owne hand, and auenge me of my soes who rise vp and rebell against me. Now what can befall them but confusion, shame and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, against whom God purposely opposeth as a sharp and seuere enemie, seeing he is so powerfull that none can stand before him in his anger, nor deliuer himselfe or any other out of his hand; but strong and weake, King and people, are all alikeliable to his plagues, when he goeth his circulte
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:10731:429"/> of visitation, and sitteth in his assizes to iudge the earth? Of which fearefull vengeance executed vpon proud potentates we haue many examples, as in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> drowned in the red<note place="margin">1.

                  </note> both ciuill and spirituall, which doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie these worldly things, when they are ouerualued aboue their worth, and immoderately affected and desired. It now followeth that wee intreate brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of those which are euerlasting in the life to come. For wel were it with worldlings, if the earthly things which they immoderately loue, were onely hurtfull to their soules and bodies whilest they continue here; for then they might set their temporall gaine against their temporall losse, and haue
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:10731:430"/> their hurts counteruailed (at least in their opinion) by their profit and benefit. But this maketh their estate most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in that their worldly delights and comforts; are but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentanie and of short continuance; and the euils and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments vnto which they haue made themselues liable, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their wicked getting or abusing them, shall be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and euerlasting. For as the wounds of the body are soone made, and long in curing; so these sores of sin which attend vpon the euill getting or keeping of earthly vanities, are made in a moment, but when they are made, they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer cured, vnlesse in this life we applie vnto them the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous balsum of Christs blood, and wash these spirituall wounds with the teares and water of true repentance. Now these euils which they bring in respect of the life to come, are either priuatiue or positiue. The priuatiue euill which these worldly things immoderately loued bring, is that they depriue and hinder those who set their hearts vpon them, of the eternall ioyes of heauen. For the Psalmist, enquiring of the diuine Oracle of truth: <hi>who shall ascend into the mountaine</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 24. 3. 4.</note>

                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 26. 27.</note>
                  <hi>after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called; but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise▪ and God hath chosen the weake things of the world, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the mighty things; and vile things of the world, and things which are despised hath God chosen, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are.</hi> And in another place hee tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, that <hi>he who soweth to the flesh, shall of his flesh reape cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 8.</note>
                  <hi>euen as contrariwise, he that soweth to the spirit, shall of the spirit reape life euerlasting.</hi> So that commonly those whom the world refuseth, God chuseth, whom it disgraceth, he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth; and contrariwise, they whom the world magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, those the Lord despiseth, whom it imbraceth, those he reiecteth. And hard it is and euen impossible, that our hearts should be fixed on the world, and yet our soules inherit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:10731:431"/> happinesse, that we should haue our conuersation in the world as citizens of the earth, and yet hold sure our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in Gods kingdome. And therefore as some thinke, our<note place="margin">Mark. 9. 2.</note> Sauiour before he would giue his disciples some smal glimps of that heauenly glory in his transfiguration, first withdrew them apart vnto mount Thabor, separating and diuiding them as it were from the world, to teach vs typically this les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that hee who will euer hope to see and enioy eternall glory, must first draw his affections from the world, and haue their conuersation in heauen, seeking those things which are aboue, and raising his meditations into the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Gods holinesse. To this purpose one exhorteth vs to weane our affections from the loue of these worldly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, because if our hearts bee fixed vnto them, they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue vs of euerlasting glory: Learne to contemne (saith he)<note place="margin">Bernard. de inter. domo cap. 45.</note> those things whilest thou art aliue, which thou canst not haue after thou art dead. For it is hard, yea altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, that a man should with immoderate loue enioy these temporall good things, and those that are eternall, that he should here glut his appetite, and there haue his soule sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with heauenly ioyes, and so passe from one delight to another, and appeare glorious both in earth and heauen, &amp;c. seeing the more we are delighted with earthly vanities, the more are we separated from eternall glory.</p>
               <p>Now if we would know the reasons why both these can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. The reasons why wee cannot greatly loue both earthly and heauenly things.</hi>
                  </note> stand together, and why we cannot set our hearts vpon the things of the world whilest we continue with them, and afterwards inherit heauenly happinesse; they are easily ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: for first, those who too much affect these earthly things, they too little regard, or vtterly contemne that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory in the life to come; if they be in loue with the flesh pots of Egypt, they will neuer trauell cheerefully towards the land of promise; if with <hi>Esau</hi> they more esteeme their pottage then their patrimonie, they wil take no great paines to be assured of it, or sel al their title and interest which they haue in it at the basest prizes; if they can be content with the prodigall sonne to feed on the huskes of worldly vanities, among the filthie swine, so long as they can haue plentie of
<pb n="789" facs="tcp:10731:431"/> them, they will neuer care to returne vnto their heauenly father, neither will they giue all they haue to buy this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pearle of glory, if they more esteeme their earthly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, and in comparison of them basely value those hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly treasures. So one saith, that holy delight in heauenly happinesse shunneth the heart which is prepossessed with<note place="margin">Bernard. de ascensione Domini. Serm. 6.</note> worldly desires, neither can there bee any mixture of things truely substantiall, with emptie vanities; of true▪ things with false; eternall with transitorie, spirituall with corporall, the highest with the lowest, so as a man may at the same time sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor of those things which are aboue, and those things which are beneath. For these worldly things haue in them a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching quality, whereby those who affect them, are blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they cannot see those heauenly riches, though much greater and better, and so being out of sight, they are also out of mind, and are either quite forgotten, or vtterly disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. And as he who loueth an harlot doth presently loath his wife, taking his whole delight in her companie and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton dalliance, and esteeming his owne home a iaile or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; so they who set their hearts vpon this worldly strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, doe presently contemne our husband Iesus Christ, and flee from our heauenly home, as if it were the place of their banishment. And this the Apostle implieth, where hee saith<note place="margin">

<pb n="790" facs="tcp:10731:432"/> foote forward towards their heauenly countrie. But as the Rubenites hauing taken a liking of the countrie which was first conquered, because it was fit to feed their cattell (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were farre from the Temple, where they should receiue the food of their soules) and therefore to enioy it renounced all interest in the land of promise: so these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings set their harts and affections vpon the earth and ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Or if they doe not hinder them from this heauenly happinesse, by causing them to forget and vtterly neglect it, yet at least by slacking their pace, and causing them to seeke after it negligently and remissely: and whereas there is such a zeale in those who attaine vnto the kingdome of heauen, that as our Sauiour Christ saith, they <hi>striue to enter into the straite gate,</hi> and are ready to take possession of it by an holy<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 24.</note> kind of <hi>violence and force,</hi> sparing for no paines, nor staying<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 12.</note> for any danger; these men who are wedded to the world, are cold and slacke in this pursuit, being altogether vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take any paines, or to sustaine the least brunt of any danger. Or if at any time they shew a little earnestnesse more then ordinarie, presently this zeale is quenched with these watrish and earthly vanities; and the world catching fast hold of them, maketh them to stay, and neuer ceaseth wrestling with them till they haue the foile and ouerthrow. In which conflict these worldly things are vnto them but as clothes to wrastlers, whereon their aduersarie taketh faster hold to giue them a fall; and (as one saith) the world casteth<note place="margin">Nilus in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetico.</note> vpon them this dust of earthly vanities, that he may seaze on them the surer, and keepe them from slipping out of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind imbracements; from which dangers they might bee freed, either if they were naked &amp; destitute of these worldly vanities, or at least if they kept them on as loose garments, which are easily pulled off; being not fare in loue with them

For he onely giueth his best gifts to those who best esteeme them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth his benefits vpon them alone who doe seeke and sue for them, seeing those only who feele their owne want, and acknowledge the incomparable worth of these rich gifts, wil euer be truely thankfull for them.

                  </note> And first for honours, and the vaine glory of the world, what greater impediment can there be then they, to hinder any from attaining the eternall glory of Gods Kingdome, when being inioyed or desired, they are ouerualued, and too much loued and affected? For (as I haue shewed) they make men the readie instruments of any sin (whereby a present for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture is made of our heauenly inheritance) for the getting or preseruing of their honor &amp; aduancement. They willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglect the chiefe priuiledges and perogatiues of the sons of God, and onely plot and take paines in aspiring to their ambitious ends. They are apt to despise the exercises of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and to contemne the means of their saluation, as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayer, and the ministery of the word, as better befitting the vulgar people, then such as they, who are so highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced aboue the common sort. Or if they heare the word,
<pb n="793" facs="tcp:10731:433"/> they will not regard the threatnings of Gods iudgements against sinne, nor stoope to take vpon them the yoke of Iesus Christ, submitting themselues to be guided and ruled by his ordinance, as being a thing too base, for their honour and greatness. Finally, they skorne to goe in that onely way, which leadeth to eternall life and happinesse; but chuse by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies of their owne, as though they disdained to goe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in vulgar company, or to be saued after a common fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the Lord hath appointed, that all who desire to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto heauenly happinesse, should take paines, in trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the narrow and afflicted way, and in entring the low and<note place="margin">Matth. 7. 13. 14.</note> strait gate that leadeth to life; but they refuse this difficult course, and chuse the broad way of ease and libertie▪ if not licentiousnesse.

Of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that God hath not called <hi>the mightie in the world, but the weake</hi> and helpelesse. And more<note place="margin">1.

In which respect, our Sauiour compareth riches to the bunch on the camels backe, which maketh those, who set their hearts vpon them, altogether vnfit to enter into the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and strait gate, that openeth into the ioyes of heauen. And as the camell hath not onely a natural bunch, but also an accidentall loade, both which hinder him from entring into any strait passage: so these couetous worldlings haue the naturall bunch of carnall concupiscence, and the accidentall Ioade, both of worldly riches, and of the sinnes which they haue committed in compassing or possessing them; the one whereof they must whether they wil or no lay aside in death; the other, vnlesse they shake off their burthen by true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, shall accompanie them to iudgement, and hauing the waight of Gods wrath added vnto them, shall as an intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable loade presse them into hell. For as it is impossible for a man ouerburthened to climbe to the top of a steepe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, vnlesse he lay his loade aside, or haue some assistants to carie it with him: so is it much more impossible, being loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with riches, and that guilt and sinne which vsually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth them, to ascend into the high mountaine of Gods holinesse, vnlesse we lay aside our burthen, or commit it to the poore, as our porters to carrie it with vs; making with <hi>Zacheus</hi> restitution, to those whom we haue wronged, and imparting of that which remaineth a liberall share to chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vses. In which respect (as one obserueth) riches in the<note place="margin">Senec. Epist. 87</note> Latine tongue are fitly called impediments, or incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, because nothing more then they vsually hindreth men from going on in the way of grace, nor from attaining vnto the goale of glory, they being commonly to men like bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens to those that runne a race, which keepe them from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="797" facs="tcp:10731:435"/> any speed, and tire them before they can come to the end. And as those who haue shooes farre too wide for their<note place="margin">Chrysost. hom. 7. de poeruten.</note> feete, or garments, which being farre too side, traile on the ground, are altogether vnfit to trauell a long iourney; so those who haue superfluous riches, and much more then is fit for their place and calling, are as much hindred in their iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which should bring them vnto heauen. In regard of which impossibility, for those which haue set their hearts vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on riches, to attaine vnto eternall happinesse, our Sauiour Christ pronounceth that fearefull woe against them; <hi>Woe be</hi>

Let vs lay aside our golden fetters, and deare-bought clogs, seeing we are to run the spirituall race for the crowne of glory; and not so much consider their<note place="margin">Bernard Serm. in Prou. 3. 13.</note> costly prizes, and worldly value, as how much they hinder vs in ascending into our heauenly countrie: and let vs not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle our selues with this lime of superfluitie, but only haue so much vse of these earthly things, as is requisit for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent necessities. Let vs cast away these superfluous burthens, which being kept, may make vs castawaies, and doe that for
<pb n="798" facs="tcp:10731:436"/> the feare of God, which wise Merchants doe for feare of the sea, and bee as readie to leaue our vnprofitable load of riches for the safegard of our soules, as they are for the preseruing of their momentanie liues. And let vs not goe stooping and groaning vnder this vnsupportable waight, and be hindred thereby from finishing with ioy our iourney vnto our owne countrey; seeing we may haue the poore to help vs, and case vs of our load. For if we cannot, being ouerburthened, trauel far on euen ground; how much more vnable shall we be to mount vp therewith vnto the hie mountaine of Gods holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?

For they who set their hearts on the vaine pleasures of the world, haue no affection to the pleasures which are at Gods right hand for euermore.

And if by forcible reasons and persuasions, they are moued to set forward in this iourney, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently discouraged; for being wholly addicted to case and delight, they will neuer indure the strait, rough, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant way which is full of the thornes of afflictions, and briars of tribulations; but will presently with <hi>Lots</hi> wise look back to their delightfull Sodome, with a desire to enioy
<pb n="799" facs="tcp:10731:436"/> again these pleasures of sinne, though they last but for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Besides, the Lord will not giue this chief iewell of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happinesse to these voluptuous wantons, nor cast this precious pearle before these filthie swine, who taking al their delight to wallow in the puddle of iniquitie, will not sticke contemptuously to tread it vnder their filthie feete. And therefore what possibilitie is there of their saluation, seeing they are neither willing, nor able, to seeke after this eternall happinesse; nor the Lord willing to giue it without seeking, to such idle or skorneful sluggards as doe not think it worth their paines? And thus it appeareth that these worldly things immoderatly loued, are notable impediments to hinder vs from the attaining of eternal life, and those euerlasting ioyes of Gods kingdome. The consideration whereof should weane our hearts from these worthlesse, and (through our corruption) harmefull vanities, that we may the better settle them on the meanes, whereby wee may be assured of those heauenly excellencies: and seeing when they are fastned, and as it were glued vnto vs with carnall loue, they hinder vs from attaining vnto this eternall happinesse; let vs either hold these things with such contempt and carelesse respect, that wee may with ease lay them aside, when wee finde that they hinder vs in our iourney towards our heauenly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: or if they offer to take faster hold, and to intangle vs in the snares of sinne, so as wee cannot goe forward in our course of godlinesse; let vs as the Apostle exhorteth vs, <hi>cast away euery thing that presseth downe, and the sinne that hangeth</hi>

               <p>Secondly, the more we abound with these earthly things<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 7. That the more we abound with worldly things, the greater shall be our recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the day of iudgement.</hi>

<pb n="801" facs="tcp:10731:437"/> hid their masters talent in a napkin, so as they cannot returne it with any increase? and how much more horrible then will it bee to them, who haue riotously wasted, and spent their Lords rich talents, in their wicked and worldly courses, whereby they haue dishonoured their master and hurt their fellow seruants? For what shame and confusion of face shall they bee possessed with, who haue receiued liberall wages from the Lord, that they might be the better incouraged and inabled to doe him seruice, when their Iudge shall tell them, and their owne conscience shall witnes against them, that they haue abused this rich bountie of God in the seruice of sinne and Satan, and spent his rich treasures vpon their owne lusts? how will they then desire the hils to fall vpon and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them from their wrathfull Iudge, that together with thē they may hide their reckoning? what would they then giue that they had imploied their prosperity for the setting forth of Gods glorie, and had vsed all his gifts to the honour of the giuer? and because they haue failed heereof, how many worlds, if they had them, would they part with, that they might haue but one day more to liue, wherein they might set straight their reckonings by true repentance, and faith in Iesus Christ? But then alas it will be too late, seeing the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable time and day of saluation is now past, and now their teares, groanes, sorrowes, and lamentations, shall be begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and parts of their hellish punishments; which if they had been vsed in time, and improued to the best in this life, would, through Gods gratious and free promises, and the precious merits of Iesus Christ, haue procured vnto them certaine assurance of the pardon of all their sinnes, reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with God, and of the eternall inheritance, and neuer ending ioyes of his heauenly kingdome.</p>
               <p>But let vs for the better cleering of this point insist in the<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 8. That honours, riches, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures doe but increase our bils of accounts.</hi>
                  </note> speciall examples. And first for honors; the more they are multiplied vpon men, the greater account they haue to make at the day of iudgement; for they haue receiued honor from God, that they might returne honor to him; they are by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall priuiledge made glorious before men, that they might shine before them in an holie example, and glorifie God
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:10731:438"/> more then others, whilest as precedents of godlinesse and righteousnesse, they draw on all their inferiours to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian imitation. Finally, they haue been aduanced by God to power and authoritie, that they might in his place, and as his deputies, rule their inferiours, euen as the Lord himselfe would rule, if hee were vpon the earth, countenancing the good, and discouraging the euill, rewarding vertue, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing vice, defending the innocent, and suppressing those who are vniust and iniurious, patronizing and maintaining iustice, and discountenancing vniustice, and sinne. Of which the further off they haue been from yeelding any reckoning in this life, the more strait account will the Lord take of them in the life to come. And therefore if they haue not only failed in all these duties, but wilfully neglected them, and vsed all their credit and power to quite contrarie purposes; as for example, if hauing been honoured by God, they haue dishonoured him, contemning his seruice themselues, and hindring others who would haue performed it; if they haue skorned religion, and made but a iest of godlinesse; if they haue made no conscience of swearing and forswearing, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and blaspheming; and spent all their liues in riotous and voluptuous liuing; if they haue not only themselues thus of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God, but haue made their faults scandalous, and their sinnes exemplarie, drawing on their inferiours to the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their wickednesse: If being in the place of God they haue ruled and gouerned, as the diuell himselfe would doe if hee were in a humane shape, discountenancing those who are good, and incouraging those who are euill, punishing vertue, and rewarding vice, defending the faultie, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting the innocent, and either for fauour, friends, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or respect of persons, vpholding iniustice and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and ouerthrowing iustice and right; then shall they haue a most fearefull reckoning to make at the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and wish rather that they had liued in reproch and contempt, then that hauing had all these honours and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, they should bee brought to such a dreadfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. And thus they who haue most abounded in riches, shall haue also their reckoning hereby much increased; for
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:10731:438"/> the Lord hath bestowed vpon men these talents, not that they should keep▪ them hid in a napkin, but that they should put them out to profit and aduantage; as when they imploy them to the glorie of God, in furthering the meanes of his worship and seruice, in relieuing the poore members of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and in performing the workes of mercie and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. And therefore in what a fearefull estate shall they be at this day, who haue vtterly neglected these religious and Christian vses; and contrariwise haue abused their riches, by either spending them vpon their owne lusts, in belly cheare, and brauerie, or imploying them as helpes to hinder Gods worship, and to oppresse and iniure the poore with all cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and tyrannie? Finally, what a fearefull reckoning haue they to make, who haue spent the greatest part of their liues in voluptuous pleasures, as though they had quite forgotten the end wherefore they came into the world; as in furfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drunkennes, chambring and wantonnesse, gaming and reuelling, playing and sporting; not caring to take any wicked course for the compassing of their pleasures, nor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king conscience of any delight, whether it be lawfull or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, so it may please their carnall appetite. O what reward can these men expect in this day of the Lord, when their owne consciences shall tell them, that they haue spent all their liues in the seruice of sinne and Satan, and in fulfilling the lusts of their owne flesh? What account will they then make to their Iudge, when being demanded how they haue spent their precious time, their strength, and wealth, which in plentifull manner they had receiued at the hands of God, they shall be able to make no other answer, but that they haue consumed them all in voluptuous vanities, and vtterly neglected the seruice of their Creator and continuall preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; spending all their daies either in idlenes, or luxurious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and wantonnes, which they should haue bestowed in glorifying God, and in getting assurance of their owne sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; wasting their strength in obeying their fleshly lusts, which should haue been imployed in doing seruice to their Maker and Redeemer; and bestowing all their riches in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous

For it is iust with God, that those who in this life haue abused the greatest prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, should in the life to come endure the greatest miserie: that they who are most deepely indebted to Gods bountie for his benefits, should haue the straitest imprisonment, when hauing riotously and vnthankfully spent the Lords talents, they haue nothing to pay: that they who haue most disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored God in his owne gifts, should proportionablie receiue the greatest measure of punishment: and finally, that they who hauing receiued the most liberal wages haue performed worst seruice, should be beaten with most stripes. So that at this day the abundance of these worldly things shall be but as it were the greater pile of wood, which being set on fire with the flame of Gods burning wrath, shall eternally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume them who haue thus vnthankfully abused them; and their burning concupiscence after these earthly vanities, shal but increase the furious heate of those hellish flames, which shall torment them with tortures that are intollerable, and yet endlesse and euerlasting.

<pb n="811" facs="tcp:10731:442"/> malicious persecutiōs. The which is not to be vnderstood of all men generally; for as for worldlings they haue here their citie and their paradise; but of the faithfull onely, who haue<note place="margin">Ambros. in Psal. 118. Serm. 3. Phil. 3. 20.</note> renounced earthly pleasures, carnal lusts, and worldly concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence. And (as one saith) he is to be reputed a stranger vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, who can truely say that his conuersation is in heauen, who hath his portion in the Lord, who can inwardly grieue that he liueth but too long in this place of pilgrimage and banishment, who is tired with the tediousnes of this life, and is glutted &amp; loatheth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> length &amp; prolixity of his earthly habitation, it being contrary to his desire, &amp; enforcing him often to crie out, woe be to them that dwell vpon the earth; who feareth not to be dissolued, and if he be, presumeth that he shall be with Christ. He is a citizen of the saints who hath<note place="margin">Psal. 120. 4. Phil. 1. 23.</note> laid vp his treasure in heauen. For this man departing out of this earthly Egypt, doth not desire to returne againe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he feare vnrecouerable old age, or the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of death. Hee taketh no care for the building of new barnes, for the storing vp of his corne; seeing hee is here to liue the life of a stranger, but being onely rich in fruitfull ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, he gathereth those things together, which neither old age can destroy, nor death take away.</p>
               <p>Now this consideration that we are not in our own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, but remaine for a while vpon the earth as pilgrims and strangers, should serue as an effectuall reason to weane our<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2.

                  </note> hearts from the loue of the world and worldly vanities, and to place them in heauen, and on heauenly ioyes, which is our owne countrie and place of residence. For, as we know, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims and strangers being trauelling in a farre countrie, doe not set their hearts on the things which they see by the way, because they are quickly to leaue them; but their minds and meditations doe wholly runne vpon their owne countrie, and their hearts are fixed on those pleasures, profits and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, which after their iourney is finished, they shall there enioy for tearme of life. And therefore if wee bee pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims on earth, wee must follow their practise, and not set our hearts on the world and earthly things, because we haue
<pb n="812" facs="tcp:10731:443"/> them only in our passage, and the time which wee haue to enioy them is but very short. For let him who hath enioyed worldly prosperitie the longest time looke backe, and hee shall see, that all which is past is but a dreame or shadow, and as the twinckling of an eye in respect of eternity. But all our loue and longing must be placed on our heauenly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, where we are for euer to enioy <hi>an eternall waight of glory,</hi> and happinesse without end.

The world is vnto vs a dangerous sea, and our life is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted vs as a time of passage, wherein wee may goe forward in our voyage, and discouer the port of happinesse, that with ioy we may enter into it: and therefore let vs not desire to be alwaies sailing, and to be still in danger, not onely to bee swallowed vp by the surging waues of misery and affliction; but also of the spirituall pirats, who are ready to rob vs of Gods sanctifying graces, and to captiue and inthrall vs in the prison of destruction; and of splitting our soules vpon the rockes of sin, being mislead in our voyage by the worlds false fires, and drawne out of the right way by his subtill ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: but let vs rather desire to arriue at the hauen of rest, where we shall bee free from all these dangers, and for euer enioy secure felicity. Neither must wee make account that the places where we now abide, are our homes and habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but onely our Innes and lodgings by the way, where we are not to leade our liues, but to rest for one night, and so to be gone.

Now there is no like impediment to hinder vs in this chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian course and passage, to the loue of the world and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanities, as I haue already shewed. For they who fall in loue with the place of their pilgrimage, will take neither care nor paines in trauelling towards their owne countrie; and they who set their hearts vpon these earthly trifles, will by them as by Satans baits, be led out of the way, and insnared with sinne; so as they will want all power and will to hold on the right course, but will be content for the enioying of their loue to make sale of the eternall ioyes of heauen, for the present satisfying of their desires; and therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle exhorteth all who desire to finish this iourney, that they would <hi>like strangers and pilgrims abstaine from carnall lusts</hi>

<pb n="816" facs="tcp:10731:445"/> we shall fall into Satans ambushment, be led captiue into sin, and so being chained and fettered in his bonds, we shall bee hindred from trauelling, or euer attaining vnto our heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie countrie.</p>

And therefore, as wee haue little cause to seate our hearts and affections on the world, and the vanities thereof, because we can stay here but a short time, and are euery day flitting from them; so much lesse if we consider, that this short time is full of trouble, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are on euery side beset with our spirituall enemies.

Vnto which we might adde, that as our Lord and King made but a short stay vpon the earth, but keepeth his court and residence in the new Ierusalem which is aboue: so wee his people and faithfull subiects, who are also seruants of his familie, yea, members of his glorious bodie, shall make here but a momentanie abode; but after we are departed hence, shal haue in heauen euerlasting habitations; in which respect also, as wee are here strangers and pilgrims, so may wee bee
<pb n="819" facs="tcp:10731:446"/> rightly called citizens of Heauen, and as it were free but ges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the new Ierusalem. Now what can be a more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble argument to weane our hearts and affections from the world and worldly vanities, then to consider, that as wee are here strangers, and haue no abiding or resting place; so we are subiects and citizens of that glorious Kingdome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Lord himselfe, and his Son Christ is Ruler and chiefe Soueraigne? For who would not contemne a flitting tent, in comparison of a goodly mansion and stately palace? Who would not set light by a poore tenemēt, which is possessed at the will and pleasure of the Landlord, in respect of a rich in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and a large lordship, in which he hath assurance to him and his heires for euer? Who would be a subiect of that kingdome, where the prince and soueraigne is but a slaue; whereas he might be an esteemed member of a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding monarchie? And who would preferre his pedling freedō in a country village for a few daies; before his enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizement and priuileges in the chiefe city of the countrie, which he may haue for euer? And yet all these similitudes are but some little shadowes and dark resemblances, to expresse the incomparable difference between y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> earth and heauen, the momentany trifles of this life, and those vnualuable and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall excellencies, which are reserued for the Saints in the life to come. For looke how much a monarchie is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before a molehill, the brightnesse of the Sunne, before the dim shining of a glow-worme, and the richest treasures, before the basest pebble stone; and so, and much more are those euerlasting ioies of heauen, to be preferred before the best things the world can brag off, though it were a long and flourishing Monarchie ouer all the Kingdomes of the Earth. It is true indeed, that these earthly things being neere vnto vs, and subiect to our senses, doe make a flourishing shew at the first sight, to those who are still conuersant among them, and neuer knew any thing better; but if in diuine contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, our minds and meditations could mount aloft, and be but a while exercised in the view and consideration of those incomparable ioies, which God hath prepared for his elect, these worldly and transitory things below would
<pb n="820" facs="tcp:10731:447"/> seeme little and little worth: for as hee who is feated on an exceeding high mountaine, iudgeth euery thing small which hee seeth in a low valley; so if our minds were placed in heauen, and our hearts fixed on that diuine and endlesse glory, wee would thinke the greatest things on earth, as small as motes in the Sunne, and as smally also to bee regarded; according to the example of the Apostle<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 7.</note>
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> who after hee had been rapt vp into the third hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 7. 8.</note> and had a sight and tast of those vnspeakable ioies, did in regard of them, esteeme the worlds chiefest excellencies, but as drosse and dung: whereas now alas these earthly things, though they be small and contemptible, do hide those superexceeding ioies of Gods Kingdome, from the eies of those men, who are still poring on the earth, and are neuer rapt vp on hie in spirituall meditation, but lie grouelling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, spending all their thoughts vpon their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affaires. And as a small dish being held neere the eies, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from our sight a great mountaine; and a little hill or cloud, the whole bodie of the Sunne, though it be farre big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the whole earth: so these earthly trifles being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced neere our sight, do so shadow and ouercloud these great and shining excellencies, that we cannot truly behold them, nor rightlie iudge of their greatnesse and value. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if wee would view them aright, and haue some true glimpse at least of this diuine glory, we must by heauēly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation let the eies of our soule mount aboue them; or else we must remooue them further from vs, and then they will seeme small, and smally to be regarded, in comparison of the incomparable greatnesse and goodnesse of those heauenly ioies, and euerlasting glorie.</p>

Whereas <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the father of the faithfull, <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> with the rest of the Patriarchs, liued in Tents, to shew that like pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes they were still in remouing to their owne countrey,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 9. 10.</note>
                  <pb n="828" facs="tcp:10731:451"/> as the Apostle obserueth. And therefore if we would not be like reprobate <hi>Caine,</hi> or desire to imitate these holy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches, let vs not settle our affections, and fix our hearts vpon the world, and worldly vanities; but only vse them as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries for our passage, and contemne them when we finde them impediments, or when they come in comparison of Gods spirituall graces, or heauenly ioyes.</p>
               <p>Which that we may the rather doe, let vs consider, that all<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. That all the faithfull haue from time to time contemned the world.</hi>
                  </note> Gods saints and seruants haue gone before vs in this holie practise, as precedents and examples: for no sooner were they made partakers of the gifts and graces of Gods holy spirit, and had but some little taste of the heauenly happines, but presently they contemned the world and the vanities thereof, they were readie to leaue all and follow Christ, and euen to lay downe their liues, for the profession of the Gospell. It were endlesse to name all; some few shall suffice. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> professeth, that he desired to <note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 2.</note>
                  <hi>know nothing but Iesus Christ and him crucified;</hi> and saith, <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 6. 14.</note>
                  <hi>God forbid that he should reioyce in any thing, but in the crosse of our Lord Iesus Christ; whereby the world was crucified vnto him, and hee vnto the world.</hi> Yea he <hi>accounted all things</hi>

                  <hi>sought not the praise of men,</hi> neither of the Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians nor any other. Thus also <hi>Abraham</hi> at Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement left his owne countrey, and contemned all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, pleasures, and preferments which it might haue yeelded vnto him, in comparison of the land of promise, though hee dwelt there but as <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 11. 9. 10.</note> a stranger, and had little ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in it, but onely as it was a type of the heauenly Canaan. So <hi>Moses refused to be called the sonne of Pharaohs daughter,</hi> and was content to abandon all the prosperitie which hee might haue had in the land of Egypt; <hi>and chose rather to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer aduersitie with the▪ people of God, then to enioy the pleasures of sinne for a season; esteeming the rebuke of Christ greater ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>

                  <hi>then the treasures of Egypt, and that because he had respect to the recompense of the reward,</hi> as the Apostle teacheth vs. Yea <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe though hee had all the royalties, profits, and delights, which a kingdome could affoord vnto him; yet
<pb n="829" facs="tcp:10731:451"/> could they not allure him to fixe his heart vpon them, but only hee vsed them as necessarie helpes for his iourney, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that <hi>hee was but a stranger and soiourner vpon the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Chron. 29. 15</note>
                  <hi>earth, and that his daies were like a shadow which hath no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi> Finally, no sooner were the disciples of the Primitiue Church conuerted to the faith, and had some assurance of their saluation, and some little knowledge and taste of the treasures, glorie, and ioyes, prepared for them in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God; but presently they contemned earthly riches, and hauing sold their houses and lands, laid the price downe<note place="margin">Act. 4. 34.</note> at the Apostles feete, that there might bee a distribution, to euery one according to his need. But aboue all examples, let vs propound vnto vs our Sauiour Christs, who by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world and worldly things, hath taught vs also to despise and contemne them. For being the most glorious and eternall sonne of God, he did not here in this world seek for honour and soueraigntie, yea hee refused it when it was offered, and when he <note n="i" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 15.</note> perceiued that the people sought after him to make him a King, he departed &amp; hid himself in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert place. And though he were the King of heauen &amp; earth, yet he professeth that he came <hi>into the world not to be</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Mark 10. 45.</note>
                  <hi>serued but to serue,</hi> and that he did <hi>not receiue</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Ioh. 5. 41.</note>
                  <hi>honour from men.</hi> Yea in his greatest glorie which he had amongst men, and when he would make some shew that indeed hee was a King, it is said that he came <note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 21. 5. 6.</note> meeke and lowly, sitting on an asses colt, hauing only some of his Disciples spare clothes vnder him, in stead of rich and kingly furniture. So though hee might haue had the riches of the earth at his commandement, yet hee contemned abundance, and contenting himselfe with necessaries only, he gaue the ouerplusse to the reliefe of the poore. Thus we reade that certaine women ministred to his necessities, that he had not money in his purse to pay his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, but was faine to borrow it of <note n="n" place="margin">Matth. 17. 27</note> a sillie fish, whereas hee might as easily haue commanded the seas to haue cast vp her treasures and pearles, if hee had regarded them. So himselfe saith, that <note n="o" place="margin">Matth. 8. 20.</note>
                  <hi>the foxes had holes, and the birds of heauen nests, but the sonne of man had not whereon to rest his head.</hi> All which pouertie hee willingly vndertooke, that hee might inrich vs
<pb n="830" facs="tcp:10731:452"/> with heauenly treasures; as the Apostle testifieth, <note n="p" place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 9.</note>
                  <hi>Ye know</hi> (saith he) <hi>the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, that he being rich for your sakes became poore, that ye by his pouertie might be made rich.</hi> The like contempt he also shewed of worldly pleasures, spending his time in watching, and praying, preaching, and teaching; in wearisome iourneys, and sore trauell, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it his chiefe pleasure to please his heauenly Father, and euen his <note n="q" place="margin">Ioh. 4. 34.</note> meate and drinke to doe his will. Finally, in all things our Sauiour Christ humbled himselfe, setting light by worldly prosperitie, in comparison of that glorie which was reserued for him with his Father. Whose example we also are to imitate, as the Apostle exhorteth vs: <hi>Let</hi> (saith he) <hi>the same minde be in you, that was euen in Christ Iesus, who being in the forme of God, thought it no robberie to be equall with God: but he made himself of no reputation, and tooke on him the forme of a seruant and was made like vnto men, and was found in shape as a man. He humbled himselfe and became obedient vnto the death, euen the death of the crosse; wherefore God hath also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted him, and giuen him a name aboue euery name.</hi> O why ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should wee ambitiously aspire vnto honours, seeing the sonne of God himselfe was content for our sakes to bee thus abased? Why should the seruant desire immoderatly to bee aduanced, when his Lord and Master was thus humbled? Why should wee greedily seeke after those riches which Christ Iesus the wisedome of his Father contemned; seeing if they had been absolutely good, and worth the hauing, he who is Lord of heauen and earth, might haue abounded with them? Why should wee dote vpon voluptuous plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, seeing our Sauiour spent his time in painfull labours, and attained vnto the eternall ioyes of his fathers kingdom, by trauelling in the vnpleasant way of troubles and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions? In a word, why should wee adore the world as our earthly idoll, and set our hearts and affections vpon these momentanie vanities, when as all the faithfull from time to time, haue by the contempt of them entred into euerlasting glorie? Why should we dreame of hauing a speciall dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation and priuilege, aboue all the rest of Gods faithfull chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and thinke that wee may cleaue and cling vnto the
<pb n="831" facs="tcp:10731:452"/> world and worldly things with our hearts and affections, and yet neuerthelesse rise to be possessors of that glorie, and to enioy that heauenly inheritance, notwithstanding that all these clogs doe hang vpon vs, and keepe vs downe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all the rest of Gods children in former times <hi>haue by many tribulations entred into the kingdome of heauen;</hi> and haue in<note place="margin">Act. 14. 12.</note> respect of their heart and affections (though not in regard of the possession) shaken off these cumbersome burthens, and by the contempt of worldly vanities, haue entred into that heauenly happinesse, and euerlasting glorie?</p>

                  </note> both that the world, and the vanities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are of no true worth or excellencie; and also that though they were in themselues of some value, yet not vnto vs, who are heere pilgrims and strangers, and citizens and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of another citie and countrie, euen the new Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, and heauenly Canaan. For experience teacheth vs, that though men in their trauailes doe passe by lands and kingdomes much more rich, fruitfull, and pleasant then their owne; yet because they haue neither interest, nor abiding in them, they preferre before them their owne home, and take their chiefe delight in seeing (as we say) the smoake of their owne countrie, because there is the place of their resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, wherein they haue their part and share, of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and delights which it affoordeth, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and preseruation of their liues. And we know that this proprietie maketh poore men also in the same countrie, to take more comfort and pleasure, in their own houses, though thatched, and ill furnished; and in their owne gardens, fields, and orchards, though they are rude, disordred, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant,
<pb n="832" facs="tcp:10731:453"/> then in those who appertaine vnto other men, though neuer so curious, artificiall, and delightfull. In which respect though the things of this life were to bee preferred before those of the life to come; yet by the same reason wee should little regard them, in comparison of the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we haue no right, interest, and inheritance in them, but only passe by them, and vse them as helps, whereby wee may the better be inabled to attaine vnto our iourneys end, and haue the other reserued for vs as our patrimonie, which wee shall hold for the tearme of that life which shall be endlesse and euerlasting. But as men hauing proprietie vnto those things which are most excellent, and by infinite degrees to be preferred before such things as belong vnto others, doe in comparison of their owne possessions basely esteeme, and easily contemne that, vnto which they haue no right and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; as the French man or Italian hauing goodly inheritances in their owne countries, may easily despise the deserts of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia for their barrennes, and the northerne climes almost inhabitable, by reason of their extreame cold: so this being our case, and we hauing a countrie most rich, most glorious, full of all goodnesse and blessednesse, it may bee a thing easie for all those who consider of it, to contemne and set lightly by this earthly desert, and to preferre before it our heauenly countrie, much more then the children of Israel preferred the fruitful land of Canaan, before that waste and desert wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, through which they had trauelled towards their owne countrie. But for as much as men in the world doe so much ouerualue this place of their pilgrimage, and lightly esteeme of our heauenly habitatiō; delighting thēselues here as in their paradise, and mourning &amp; fearing to depart vnto their owne home, as though it were the place of their exile and banishment: and seeing all this loue of the one, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from a supposed excellencie, and this dislike or loathing of the other, from a false conceit, that by our change, our state shall be impaired, and we in worse case then wee were before; which can proceed from nothing but from grosse ignorance, or pagan-like infidelity, whereby either we know not what ioy and happinesse is prepared for Gods saints, or

The which because they speake sparingly in this argument, in respect of the glory and greatnesse of these surpassing ioyes; therefore I would admonish the reader, that hee doe not expect any full or perfect description of them, seeing this is altogether impossible, either to me, or any other liuing, whilest wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine here in this place of our pilgrimage, as being a secret which is not to be reuealed by discourse, but by experience<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>we shall be;</hi> and the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that God <hi>dwelleth in the light which none can attaine vnto, whom neuer man saw, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can see.</hi> Of which our insufficiency in comprehending these heauenly mysteries, diuers reasons may bee rendred: first, because the Lord would haue the ful and perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of these diuine excellencies concealed, to exercise hereby our faith, loue, obedience and patience; for he would haue vs whilest we continue here to liue by faith, and not by sight, to seeke after these ioyes vpon his word, though wee haue no distinct and sensible knowledge of them in our selues; to doe our worke and performe our dutie as well for loue to himselfe, as for the reward which we are to receiue,
<pb n="834" facs="tcp:10731:454"/> and hauing done what he inioyneth vs, wholly to referre the wages to his owne bountie. Whereas if there were a cleere and distinct knowledge of those heauenly excellencies, and surpassing ioyes in euery one of vs, it were not thankswor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be a christian, neither had we any occasion of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our faith, loue, and willing obedience vnto God, seeing they would rauish vs with their beautie and excellencie, and make vs respectiue of our dutie, if not for loue towards God, yet at least for the reward sake. And this cause the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> seemeth to intimate, where he saith, that hee <hi>was taken</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2, Cor. 12. 4.</note>
                  <hi>vp into paradise, and there heard words, which could not again be spoken by him, and which were not lawfull for man to vtter;</hi> as being secrets of State, the knowledge whereof was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to those who were admitted citizens &amp; free burges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of that glorious kingdome. Another cause may bee our imperfection in knowledge, which is a fruit and punishment of our sinne, accompanying vs as long as wee continue in this life. For the Apostle telleth vs, that <hi>wee know but in part,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 9. 12.</note>
                  <hi>and see as through a glasse darkely:</hi> and that to <hi>see face to face,</hi> and <hi>to know as we are knowne,</hi> is reserued for the life to come. So that when we haue sought out as much as wee can these inscrutable and hidden mysteries, we may crie out with <hi>Iob;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 26. 14.</note>
                  <hi>Lo these are part of his waies; but how little a portion heare wee of him? and who can vnderstand his fearefull power?</hi> Neither need this to seeme strange vnto any, if wee doe but consider that our knowledge and vnderstanding hath receiued so great a maime by▪ our originall sinne, that wee are ignorant for the most part of the things appertaining to this life, knowing them not in their true nature, formes, and essence, but onely in their figures, qualities, and properties; and that not by a present, immediate and cleere vnderstanding, but onely by sense, obseruation, induction, and experience. In which respect it is impossible to make a blind man by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions cleerely to know the nature of colours, and to conceiue of the brightnesse of the sunne, because hee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth▪ those organs and instruments of knowledge which should conueigh it to the common sense, phantasie, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding: or to make a man perfectly to conceiue of the
<pb n="835" facs="tcp:10731:454"/> sweetnesse of honie, and the delightfull odour of a rose, who wants those senses of tast and smelling. And this reason the author of the booke of Wisedome plainely expresseth: <hi>Hardly</hi> (saith hee) <hi>can we discerne the things that are vpon</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wisd. 9. 16.</note>
                  <hi>earth, and with great labour find wee out the things that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs; and who then can seeke out the things that are in heauen?</hi> To which purpose another saith, that it is not for vs in this<note place="margin">Bernard. super Cantica, Serm. 38.</note> time of ignorance, whilest we remaine in our earthly bodies, to mount into the clouds, to pierce this fulnesse of light, to breake into this bottomlesse profunditie of glory, or to dwel in this vnapprochable brightnesse: for this is reserued for our last day, when we shall be presented vnto God, glorious, and without spot or wrinckle; for how shall wee see God in his glory, and behold the beautifull brightnesse of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly habitation; seeing our vnderstandings are so blinded with ignorance, that we doe not know our selues, nor in any perfection conceiue what our owne soules are, which is the chiefe part of our essence and being? Finally, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble till we come to heauen, and haue our vnderstandings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened and inlarged by him who first made them, that we should conceiue, and comprehend these ioyes in regard of their greatnesse, and surpassing excellencie; for as our weake eyes cannot behold the sun, but it presently dazleth them, and if they bee not turned away maketh them blind, because this too excelling obiect corrupteth the sense: so our weake vnderstandings cannot possiblie conceiue and comprehend the glorious brightnesse of these heauenly ioyes; and if aboue their reach and capacity they attempt it, they are presently surcharged with their glory and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And the reason hereof is cleere and euident; for seeing this glory and happinesse consisteth principally in the vision and fruition of God, who is infinite and incomprehensible; therefore it is as impossible in this life for any man to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, as to containe the ocean in the shell of a nut. To which purpose one saith, what this eternall glory is, with<note place="margin">August. tom. 10.

<pb n="836" facs="tcp:10731:455"/> But yet though this heauenly glory cannot be fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, it is not wholly to be pretermitted, though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be purtrayed (as it were) in liuely colours, yet it is not to be left vnshadowed; for seeing wee know but in part,<note place="margin">

               <p>First therefore that we may haue some small glimpse of this glorie, we are to know, that this Kingdome of God, and ioies of heauen, is nothing else but that chiefe happinesse and supreme felicitie, which the holy Saints, who haue faithfullie serued God in this life, shall eternally inioy with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and his sonne Christ, in the life to come; whilest being freed from all worldly euils and miseries, they doe commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in all the heauenly happinesse, and vnspeakeable bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse prepared for them, especially in the fruition of God, who being infinit in all perfection, shall bee all in all vnto them. Which ioies, that we may the better conceiue of, let vs first consider of the names, titles, and epithets, which in the Scriptures are giuen vnto them; and afterwards speake, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the measure of knowledge reuealed vnto vs, of the parts thereof. Concerning the former, wee haue of them great varietie in the booke of God▪ whereby both the great excellencie, perfect sufficiencie, incomparable glory, rauish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delight, &amp; eternal felicitie of this heauēly glory is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and signified. The greatnesse and excellencie of this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall blessednesse is noted, when as it is called a <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 25. 34. Luke 12. 32.</note>
                  <hi>Kingdome,</hi> seeing there is no riches, glorie, or pleasures which a Kingdō affordeth not: and lest we should conceiue that it yeeldeth no better treasures, honours and delights, then earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes doe, it is called the <note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 7. 31. &amp; 18. 3.</note>
                  <hi>Kingdome of heauen:</hi> to note vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, that as farre as heauen exceedeth earth in largenesse, statelinesse, height and beautie, so much the priuiledges and roiall prerogatiues of this heauenly kingdome, exceed the earthly in greatnesse and in glorie. Yea, it is called also the <note n="c" place="margin">Acts 4. 22.</note>
                  <hi>Kingdome of God,</hi> to shew vnto vs, that it is absolute in all perfection, and as farre aboue earthly Kingdomes in maiestie and true felicitie, as the King of Kings excelleth the pettie

And therefore looke how much the chiefe citie of the Kingdome, and the Princes roiall court doe excell in riches and glorie, the poorest and remotest countrie village: and so, and much more doth this heauenly citie, and court roiall of the King of Kings, excell all worldly empire and dominion. The perfect sufficiencie of these heauenly ioies is also noted by the names which are giuen vnto them; for they are called a <note n="e" place="margin">Apoc. 7. 17. &amp; 21. 6.</note>

For there (as one saith) is infinite ioy, mirth without mourning▪ health without sicknesse, a pleasant way without labour▪<note place="margin">August.

Whosoeuer then is a citizen of this new Ierusalem, and made partaker of this heauenly happines, he shall be perfectly freed from all those euils, with which this fraile life is so much molested, and indued with al good, and inriched with all blessings and benefits, of which in this world, we are so destitute and naked. Now the euils vnto which in this life wee are subiect, are either priuatiue, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in the absence of those things which are good; or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiue, consisting in the presence of those things which are euill; and both these respect, either the soule, or body alone, or the whole person.

And finally, the want of Gods image, chiefly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in wisdome, righteousnesse and holinesse; which is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly defaced by our fall, and these excellent graces of God cleane blotted out.

And that which ought chiefly to comfort vs, our wils shall be most free, but yet inclinable onely to chuse that which is good; like the wil of God himself, who though he most freely willeth, yet he neuer willeth any euil, his wil being the perfect rule of all Iustice; so that we shall not only not chuse any euil or sinne, but not haue any inclination or abilitie to make such choice, both because our sanctification shal be then most perfect, which is now imperfect and onely begun; whereof it wil come to passe that we shal haue a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hatred of sinne, and a perfect loue of righteousnesse and holinesse; and also because our wils shal neuer be forsaken of God, and left to themselues, but shal alwaies be so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and powerfully ruled and gouerned by the most wise and iust wil of God, that it shal not be possible for them to erre, or to digresse any whit out of the way of iustice and truth. In which respect our wil shal not be like vnto <hi>Adams,</hi> arbitrarie to good or euil, or mutably and changeably good; but like Gods wil, most immutable and constant in al good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, righteousnesse and holinesse, so as it shal be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impossible vnto vs, either to wil that which God nil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
<pb n="845" facs="tcp:10731:459"/> or to nil that which he willeth: the which immutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in goodnesse, shal not then be grounded on our owne strength and abilities of nature, for then had we cause iustly to feare, that we might like <hi>Adam</hi> be againe circumuented by Satans subtilties; but it shal haue this firmenesse and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutabilitie from Gods eternal loue and election, which is immutable, and on his gratious and neuer failing promises, which (as the Apostle saith) are Yea and Amen, subiect to no change or alteration: for hee who hath promised that our ioyes shal be eternal, hath consequently vndertaken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue vs from falling into any sinne, which would cut off our happines, &amp; ruine our ioy. To this purpose one of the anciēts speaketh no lesse excellently then fitly; The first free wil (saith he) which was giuen to man, when he was first crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in righteousnesse and holinesse, was that he was able not to sinne, but withal that he could also sinne if he would: but our free wil in heauen shal be much more powerful then this, in that it shal haue no power to sin; but this shal be the gift<note place="margin">

For as the first im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie which <hi>Adam</hi> lost by sinning, was to be able not to die, but his last shal be, not to be able to die; so the first free wil was, to be able not to sin; but the last free wil shal be, not to be able to sin; for our willing of righteousnes and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, shal be alike vnloseable with our felicitie, &amp;c. The other euil from which our wils shal be freed, is, impotencie and inabilitie, to effect that which they wil; for in this life although they do with al earnestnesse desire many things; yet they are not able to atchieue them, because they are not agreeable and conformable to the wil of God, and therefore he crosseth and frustrateth them: but in the life to come they shal be effectual and powerful in atchieuing whatsoeuer they desire, because they are in al things agreeable and subordinat to the wil of God, and consequently do most surely attaine vnto their ends; seeing there is no power in heauen or in
<pb n="846" facs="tcp:10731:460"/> earth, which is able to crosse and defeate the wil of God, his wil being most wise and immutable, and his power omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and vnresistable. To which purpose the same Author (as<note place="margin">August. de Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu &amp; Anima. lib. cap. 64.</note> it is ascribed vnto him) saith, that because our wils are one and the same with Gods wil, therefore we shal be after a sort omnipotēt, in bringing our wils to passe, as God also is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotēt: for as God can do whatsoeuer he wil do by himself, so shal we do whatsoeuer we wil do by him, because we shal wil nothing else, but that which he also willeth, and he also willeth whatsoeuer we will and desire, and whatsoeuer he willeth that must necessarily come to passe; seeing he is most powerful and omnipotent to effect his wil. Now if worldly Princes and potentates account it a chiefe part of their regal happinesse, that they may haue their wils; though in truth they are as often crossed herein as inferiour persons, partly through the repugnancie and opposition of their owne pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and desires, and partly through the discrepancie and contrarietie of their state affaires, and of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues which they desire to effect: &amp; though when they haue their wils they receiue thereby little comfort and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because oftentimes being led by passion, they are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the reuealed wil of God, reason, and euen the light of nature, which worketh in them both afore and after their wils are accomplished, grieuous conflicts betweene their wil and their conscience, terrors, feares, and many troubles of mind: how infinitly more happie shal the poorest Saint of God be in the kingdome of heauen, when in al things which they can desire they shal haue their wil, without any crosse or opposition; and it being wholly conformable to the wil of God, and to the rule of holy reason, shal also haue in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing of it, ioy, peace and ful contentment, not only because it is done, but also because God and their owne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and conscience approue the doing of it?</p>
               <p>The like also may be said of our memories, for whereas in<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. That our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences shall haue in them no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection or corruption.</hi>

Finally, our consciences in the fruition of these heauenly ioyes shal be freed from al their corruptions, vnto which in this life they are subiect; as from their impuritie, stupiditie and sleepines; or their terrible accusations, horrors, and feares; and being full of ioy and peace, in regard that al our actions and endeauours shal be most holy, righteous, and agreeable with the wil of God, they shal only obserue our hearts, affections, and actions, (not as in this life to preuent their disorder, and digressions, that they may recal and reclaime them) but that taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their perfect conformitie with the wil of God, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing them, they may thereby continually renue our ioy and comfort, and minister matter vnto vs of praysing and glorifying God, for preseruing vs in this puritie and holines.

               <p>And these, with many more, are the euils from which our<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. Of the good things which shall be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to our bodies; and first spirituall qualities.</hi> 1. Cor. 44. 45.</note> bodies shall be deliuered. The good things, and excellent parts, which shall be communicated vnto them, are diuers. As first, they shal be spirituall bodies, as the Apostle also te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth: <hi>It is sowne a naturall body, and is raised a spirituall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. There is a naturall bodie, and there is a spirituall body: As it is written, the first man</hi> Adam <hi>was made a liuing soule, and the last</hi> Adam <hi>was made a quickening spirit</hi> &amp;c. Whereby we are not to vnderstand that the substance of our bodies shall bee spirituall, or that they shall bee turned into spirits; for wee shall rise with the same bodies, consisting, in respect of their substance, of flesh and bones, as they now doe. Neither doth the Apostle say that wee shall become spirits, but that wee shall haue spirituall bodies. Now it is one thing to bee a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or spirituall substance, and another thing to haue a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall body; for a spirit hath neither flesh nor bones, but a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall body hath both. Againe, it is vnnaturall and impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a body to bee changed into a spirit, seeing they haue not the same matter; and contrary also to the Scriptures, which teach vs, that man shall rise to inherit glory: now a perfect man consisteth as well of a body as of a soule; and therefore hee cannot bee all spirit, but must haue as well a corporall as a spirituall substance. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

<pb n="854" facs="tcp:10731:464"/> his owne eyes should behold him.</hi> Finally, such as our Sauiour Christs body was, such also shall ours be; but hee had a true, materiall▪ and physicall body, consisting of flesh and blood, which might not onely bee seene, but also handled; for so himselfe saith; <hi>Behold my hands and my feet, for it is I my selfe;</hi>

And not like them in all things, but in not eating and drinking, marrying, and giuing in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and such like. Whereas therefore the Apostle saith, that we shall haue spirituall bodies, and opposeth them to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and physicall bodies, it is not to be vnderstood general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all naturall bodies, but of such alone as wee now haue, which are subiect to mortality and corruption. Neither is it his meaning, that they shall bee spirituall in regard of their substance, which shall be one and the same as now it is, but in diuers other respects. As first, because they shall be quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by the spirit of God, and be preserued and continued in their liues, by the vertue and vigour of this spirit, which dwelling primarily and aboue measure in Christ our head, is from him communicated to vs who are his members; and shall no more liue by their animall facultie, nor need for the preseruation of their liues, meate, drinke, clothing, sleepe, physicke and such like helpes, which are altogether necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in this state of mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ality. In which respects they shal cease to be naturall bodies, as they shall bee freed from these ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall faculties, of nourishing, encreasing and multiplying by generation; for no more shall they liue by vertue of meate and drinke thrice concocted; first in the stomacke, turning it to chylus; then in the miseraicke veines and liuer, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it into blood; and lastly in the seuerall parts, when it is turned into their substance, either for the augmentation or preseruation of the body; but shall be spirituall and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, liuing without all these helpes, by sole vertue of Gods spirit, and that life which they communicate from Christ their head, and so shall in respect of this spiritual quickening
<pb n="855" facs="tcp:10731:464"/> become spirituall, euen as the wax of the candle being kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by the fire becommeth a flame, and like vnto the fire whereby it is kindled. But yet it shall remaine naturall, as it still retaineth his owne substance, and the faculties of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, sense, and motion, whereby it shall still bee guided and gouerned; by vertue of that power which our soules shall receiue from the spirit of God. Againe, they may bee called after the resurrection, spirituall, because they shall in all things bee subiect to Gods spirit, and bee by it wholly ruled and gouerned; for that which in this behalfe the soule is in this life to the body, that in the life to come shall the spirit of God be to both soule and body, obeying it in all things, not in part onely and imperfectly as in this world, but most perfectly, wholly, and willingly▪ without the least dislike or reluctation. In which respect also it may bee called spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as it doth attaine vnto spiritual, angelicall, and most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and free obedience. And with this agreeth the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">August. de fide &amp; symbolo cap. 5. tom. 3.</note> of that worthie ancient. When as (saith he) we heare that our bodies are to become spirituall, we are not so to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it, as though our body should bee changed into a spirituall substance, and so become a spirit; for neither our body now which is called animall is not changed into a soule, but retaineth his owne substance. But that is said to be a spirituall body, which is so in all things subiect to the spirit of God, as befitteth that heauenly habitation, all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane fragility, and earthly infirmity, being changed and turned into heauenly purity, and immortality. Finally, our bodies shall be spirituall, in regard that they shall be indued and adorned with spirituall qualities; for to this end the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles discourse wholly tendeth, not to shew that they shall haue their substance spirituall in the resurrection, but onely<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> their qualities; that whereas now they are mortall, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, earthly, and indued with earthly qualities, as heauines, slownesse, faintnesse, weakenesse and the rest; they shall then become immortall, incorruptible, heauenly, and indued with heauenly and spirituall qualities.</p>

And if the water which is naturally heauie, can be made so thin and subtill, that it han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in the aire, and is caried about with the wind; how much more may a glorified body, quickened by Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, be freed from it dull heauinesse, and haue power to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, and to moue which way the soule pleaseth to guide it? Againe, we see by experience, that the heauier a body is, the slower it naturally is, and vnfit for motion, and the lighter it is, the more swift and nimble; and yet who seeth not, that a mans body which is leane and weake, though it be light, yet moueth slowly; and that his body who is in good liking, strong and vigorous, though it bee more heauie, is quicke and swift in motion? If therefore health can worke this great difference, and make that which is heauie to be caried by another, light to be caried by it selfe; euen as the want thereof maketh that heauie to it selfe, which is light vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; how much more shal this be effected by immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the quickening vertue of Gods powerfull spirit? But
<pb n="857" facs="tcp:10731:465"/> whether this motion shall be equal in swiftnesse to our soule<note place="margin">August. de Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. &amp; anima lib. cap. 65. <hi>Erunt quippe ula corpora vt animus agili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Finally, our bodies being freed from their earthly grosnesse, shal bee subtil and of a much more fine and pure substance, not by diminution of their quantitie, for in this respect it shall retaine al his dimensions, not by reason of any rarefaction, as water is made subtill, in the mists and clouds; for then our bodies could not be felt, as our Sauiour Christs was after his resurrection; but in respect of the compleate perfection of it, in it essence and kind, which perfection it hath from the dominion of Gods spirit dwelling in it, and of the glorified soule which doth informe it, vnto which it is subiect; and by reason of this perfection which it hath from them, is fit and able for the performing of all actions and motions of the soule wherein it will imploy it; for otherwise it would still be a burthen and hinderance to the soule as it is in this life. And in respect of this subtility; whereby it is fitted to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, and as it were the ready instrument of the soule, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee hindred in it motion▪ by the opposition of any solid body, nor yet included, imprisoned, or violently detained in any place. Of which wee haue an example in our Sauiour Christs body after his resurrection, which by reason of the subtility thereof did suddenly appeare vnto his Apostles, and<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 31.</note> presently againe disappeared, and also did come amongst them into the roome where they were, the doores being<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 19.</note> shut; not by penetrating their substance, which is against the nature of a body, consisting of flesh and bones; but by their inuisible yeelding to giue passage to this most perfect body, that it might hereby bee imployed in such actions as his holy spirit, and most diuine soule thought fit. Finally, to this subtiltie we may also referre that most acute, quicke, and exquisite perception and comprehension of the senses, which the glorified body shal haue, and the puritie of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="858" facs="tcp:10731:466"/> whereby (notwithstanding they communicate with the body) they shall bee most obedient and seruiceable to the mind, and no more trouble and disturbe it with their grosnesse and impurity.</p>
               <p>Vnto these spiritual qualities we may adde diuers others,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. That our bodies shall be indued with great strength, and freed from suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any hurt.</hi>
                  </note> as namely, they shall bee indued with great power and strength, and enioy for euer most perfect health: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now the soule being a spirit, mighty, and powerfull, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not shew it strength, because of the weaknesse of the body, which is it organ and instrument; in respect whereof we see by experience, that it exerciseth it functions and actions more strongly or weakely, according to the measure of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily strength and health which it vseth and imployeth: in our heauenly countrie our bodies shall enioy such perfect health, and bee indued with such powerfull strength, that they shal match the ability of the soule, and become so fit for it in vigour and might, that it shall not as it doth now hinder the actions thereof with it weaknesse, and wearines, but become a perfect and sufficient instrument for all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. And this quality the Apostle attributeth vnto it, where he saith, that <hi>it is sowne in weakenesse▪ but is raised in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 43.</note> So also they shall be indued with impassibility, and bee freed from suffring any hurt or detriment from any outward agent, to which in this life they are so much subiected; and consequently they shall bee freed from all alteration, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution, and corruption: for seeing all passion or suffering proceedeth from an ouerbearing power of the agent ouer the patient; and for as much as nothing can thus ouerrule, but by ouercomming the forme of the patient, which resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth all outward force as long as it hath any ability: and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, seeing our humane bodies shal be perfectly subiected vnto our soules, by which they are informed, euen as the soule also is perfectly subiected vnto God; by whose vertue and power they are defended from all outward violence, hurts and iniuries; therefore necessarily they become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passible, and free from euill, because there is no outward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent able to ouercome our powerfull soules, and the more powerfull spirit of God; nor so strong and mighty to hurt
<pb n="859" facs="tcp:10731:466"/> our bodies, as they are to preserue and defend them.</p>
               <p>Finally, they shall bee adorned with most compleat and<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect 7. That our bodies shall be beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and of a comely stature and proportion.</hi>
                  </note> perfect beautie, and that both in respect of the comely and due proportion, and symmetrie of al the parts and members, and fit quantity and stature of the whole body; and also in respect of the colour and complexion. So that then our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies shal be freed from al maimes, defects, and monstrous shapes, from all deformities, blemishes, and disgraces; from al disproportion, and vnseemely shape of the members one with another, and in themselues: and the whole man shal bee adorned and graced with a goodly shape, feature and comelinesse. And as there shal bee perfection of al the parts of the body, so also of the whole in respect of age and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For although wee can gather little concerning this point directly and plainely out of the Scriptures, yet may it be inferred by consequence, and concluded by good reason; for if old age and childhood be the infirmities and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of man, the one not hauing attained the perfection of nature, and the other being past it, and the middle age most compleat and perfect, and seeing both a giantlike and dwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish stature, are the aberrations of nature, and much more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect then a proportionable person, and a body of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient and comely quantity; then it wil follow hereupon that al the saints of heauen shal bee of a middle and perfect age, and though not of an exact equality, yet of a comely and goodly stature, for as much as in the state of blessednesse al imperfections and infirmities shal bee taken away, and that which is most perfect and excellent shal be receiued and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed. And of this I am the more certainely persuaded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God in the first creation, making man his most perfect creature, did make him neither a child nor old man, but of a middle and perfect age, nor yet of huge stature (for giants came long after, through that monstrous and vnequal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the sons of God with the daughters of men) nor of<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 4.</note> dwarfish smalnesse, in which there is no maiesty or comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; but of such a meane and conuenient stature, as might make maiesty and beauty meet to gether; and therefore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our resurrection shal be a renouation, and (as it were) a
<pb n="860" facs="tcp:10731:467"/> new and more perfect creation, then the first in <hi>Adam;</hi> it is more then probable, that there will bee a conformitie, and likenesse betweene them, sauing that the latter shall be much more perfect and excellent, God then purposing to shew his extraordinarie goodnesse, mercie, wisdome and power, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing the blessed estate and condition of the vessels of grace, whom he hath chosen to honour and euerlasting glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Againe, if the Lord promiseth to his Church, euen in the state of imperfect regeneration, such a vigorous and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing condition, that there should bee neither child nor old<note place="margin">Esa. 65. 20.</note> man amongst them, in respect of the infirmities and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of these ages, but all should bee of full and perfect strength; how much more will he conferre and bestow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs this vigorous perfection and strength in our reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and state of glorie? Finally, we know that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ continued in this life to his perfect age, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> time, wherin according to the common course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his bodie shuld haue declined, he laid it aside by death, and after rising againe, he ascended with it into glorie in this perfect age.

Now if we further adde, that this beautie and brightnesse, shal be ioyned with great maiestie and glorie, what can bee added to this excellencie and perfection? but herein we shal us much excell the Sunne, as a liuing reasonable, and glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed creature excelleth another which is destitute of life, sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and meerely natural; at which the Apostle aimeth, where he saith, that though our bodie be <note n="a" place="margin">1.

And for order sake let vs distinguish them into ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those ioyes the matter whereof we shall haue within vs; or those which are grounded on such things as are with vs and about vs. And first wee are to know that the image of God, which was wholly defaced and blotted out by sin, and is but in part only repaired by regeneration in this life, shall be perfectly renued and restored in the life to come. For as in our first creation we were made according to this image and similitude; so shall wee in farre greater perfection be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto this diuine beautie in our regeneration at the last day; for then in our soules shall be a liuely resemblance of the wisedome, holinesse, and righteousnesse of God, and our bodies also shall carrie some similitude of him, not in their matter and substance (for they are corporall, and hee spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall) but in their beautie, brightnes, and glorious maiestie.

The which though it may seeme a riddle, yet wee may easily resolue it, if we consider that we haue this thirsting fulnes of ioy frō the fruition of God himself, who being infinite in all perfection, must needs fully satisfie all those who enioy him; &amp; because he is thus infinite there can be no tedious cloying, or loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some glutting, seeing they haue in him continuall and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse varietie of ioyes and delights; and being satisfied with the fruition of some, they see others after which they thirst and hunger. Neither must we thinke that they are wearie of the old, when they affect new, for this is only incident to worldly ioyes, which being imperfect doe not bring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; but euen the same heauenly ioyes, at the same true, worke both satietie and thirst, because being absolute in all perfection, they giue full contentment, and contenting vs they inflame our loue, and because wee loue them, they kindle still in vs a thirsting desire, to haue still the fruition of that which wee loue no lesse dearely then deseruedly.

And this (as I take it) is cleere enough in the Scriptures. In the twelfth of <hi>Daniel</hi> it is said, <hi>that they that be wise shall shine as the brightnes of the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>

The Apostle also seemeth to signifie this, where hee saith, that <hi>as there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glorie of the Sunne, and another glorie of the Moone, and</hi>

For whereas it may be obiected, that the reason followeth not, because the wicked are punished for their sinnes, but the faithful are not saued for their merits, but by the obedience, righteousnesse, and death of Christ, which equally appertaineth to al the faithful: To this I answere, first, that God hath not only in general promised vnto all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting life, for the death and merits of Christ, but also that he will of his free grace, and infinit bountie reward men according to their own works which they haue done in the flesh; for so the Apostle saith, that <hi>we must all appeare before</hi>

                  <hi>the iudgement seate of Christ, that euery man may receiue the things which are done in his bodie, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or euill.</hi> Secondly, howsoeuer euerlasting life belongeth to al them who haue their part and interest in the death and obedience of Christ, yet for as much as these are diuersly applied, by some more weakely, by others more strongly, according to the diuers measure and degree of their faith; so answerabiie these diuers degrees, shal haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers

Finally, in the inchoation and beginning of our glorification, which is in this life, when as being sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied we are endued with peace of conscience, and ioy in the holy Ghost, there are diuers degrees of grace, holinesse, and spirituall ioy and comfortt, some hauing a greater, and some a lesse measure; and therefore the Lord being constant, vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and immutable in his courses and proceedings, we may conclude, that he wil obserue the same tenure in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing and perfecting our glorification, giuing vnto those a greater measure, and higher degree of glorie and happines in his kingdome, who in this life had the greatest begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and largest proportion of grace and sanctification. But against this is obiected the parable of the labourers in the vineyard, where all are said to haue equality of reward, and the last as well as the first to haue receiued a penic. To which
<pb n="881" facs="tcp:10731:478"/> I answere, that the scope of this parable is not to shew, that there shal be equalitie of rewards in the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but that God in his inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t mercle wil giue vnto those who are called at the last houre euerlasting life, as wel as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them who are first called; therefore those who are first called, haue no cause to triumph and insult ouer those who are called last: but hereupon it followeth not, that because they haue the same kingdome, glorie, and happinesse, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they shal haue the same degree; seeing we may all haue the freedome and general priuiledges of the same citie, and yet haue therein diuers offices and preferments. Al shal haue indeed the same life, glorie and happinesse, in respect of the obiect which is the Lord himselfe and the ioyes of heauen; but al shal not (as I haue shewed) haue equal application, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, and capicitie in conceiuing and comprehending of these obiects, by reason whereof one shal containe more ioy and happinesse then another, though al shal be full and perfectly replenished. Others obiect, that all shall haue the fruition of our <hi>summum bonum</hi> and chiefest happinesse; and therefore if al haue the chiefest happinesse, none can be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour vnto other. Vnto which the same answere serueth: for al shal equally enioy the <hi>summum bonum,</hi> the obiect and cause of our happinesse; but not in equalitie, in respect of the application and comprehension of this infinit good and chiefe happines, which (as I haue said) shal be in diuers mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and degrees. Finally, whereas they obiect, if some haue a greater measure of ioy and happines then others, then they shal want who haue not so much as they; and wanting shal not be fully satisfied and contented, but contrariwise shal be apt to enuie those who excell them, and to wish their owne aduancement; al which argue insufficiency and imperfection, from which that heauenly happinesse is exempted. To this I answere, that though there be not equalitie of ioy, yet there is sufficiencie, seeing euery one shal be filled, and haue as much ioy and happines as he can containe or yet desire; and consequently being fully satisfied and contented they shal not enuie any superiour, or desire to change. For as a lesser por needeth not, nor (if it had reason) would desire, to haue
<pb n="884" facs="tcp:10731:479"/> as much powred into it, as into a greater, because it is insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to containe it, and being full, the ouer plus would but spill and run ouer; and as no man, but a glutton, being filled and satisfied at a daintie banquet, would enuie his fellow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his stomacke containeth more; and none but a foole, being of a low stature would once desire to be apparelled in the cloths of a taller mā, but rather such as are fit for his own personage; so euery Saint being filled and fitted with a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient measure of glorie and happines, is wel contented with his estate, and desireth not such a proportion as is vnmeete and vnfit for him. Againe, being fellow-members of the same bodie, whereof Christ Iesus is the head, we shal be content with that proportion of glory and happines, which is fit for vs in our seuerall places, as being most comely and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent both for the part it selfe, and for the whole body; for as the members of the naturall bodie are contented with their owne beautie, proportion, and place; because if they should be greater or lesser, higher or lower, or not themselues, but the same with others, or finally any other way disposed, then as they are in their owne nature and creation, it were vnto themselues a deformitie, and would make the whole bodie monstrous; and therefore the hand or foot, desire not to be the head or heart, nor enuie vnto them their greater honor and dignity: so the members of this heauenly body, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with that they are, and desire to be no other, nor enuie their superiours in glorie, their greater aduancement; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause al haue receiued such a measure of glory as is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient and comely, both for themselues, and for the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perfection of the whole body; and to be higher or lower then Gods wisdome hath disposed of them, would but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and disgrace the whole, and euery seuerall part. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though there be inequality of glory, there can be no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōtent in any, because he hath not so much, nor enuy towards another, because he hath more; seeing like the members of the same bodie they receiue their greater excellencie and perfection, not for themselues alone, but for the good of all their fellow-members, and of the whole bodie: and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, because through that perfection of loue which shall be

And first for the place of our happinesse, it is not the earth, aire, or firmament, wherein the starres are fixed, but the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 26.</note> of heauens, or the supreme and highest heauen, into which Christ as hee was man ascended, and so was made higher then all the visible heauens, as the Apostle speaketh;<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 2.</note> which is also that which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the third heauen, into which he was taken vp. Howsoeuer some think that after the resurrection, the blessed saints shal not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to any place, but haue the vse both of heauen and earth for their habitation, in both which they shal enioy the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, and al diuine and heauenly happinesse. The which their opinion they ground vpon those places of Scripture, where it is not onely said, that there shal bee new<note place="margin">a Esa. 65. 17. and 66. 22.

Pet. 2. 13.</note> and that the saints being <note n="c" place="margin">Apoc. 5. 10.</note> made kings shal reigne vpon the earth. But concerning this point I can determine nothing; only let vs know this to our ioy and comfort, that wheresoeuer the situation of this seat of blessednesse shal be, it is certainely most glorious and maiestical. Neither must
<pb n="884" facs="tcp:10731:480"/> we thinke that the Lord hath onely prouided for vs goodly and rich furniture, but also stately palace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and glorious mansions. For if earthly kings will haue habitations answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the greatnes of their maiesty, wherein they keepe their chiefe residence; then how glorious and ful of stately maiesty is this heauenly palace, which is the chiefe seat of the King of kings, where he communicateth himselfe to his chiefe nobles and courtiers, the holy Angels, and blessed Saints? But hard and impossible it is to describe in a liuely maner, the excellencie and statelinesse of this glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and city of the saints, in al the particulars thereof; only this we may conclude, that it is; first, of most large and almost infinite extent and circuit, seeing it is to be the seat and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of innumerable Saints and Angels, vnto the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty whereof is required that it be most ample and spatious, that they may haue liberty and roome enough. For as it is one part of the wickeds disgrace and punishment, that they shal be thrust together in a straite roome, and like stincking tares and noisome weeds bee crusht together, and tied in<note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And this appeareth also by euidence of reason: for if the visible heauens be so many and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable degrees greater then the earth; then how much more ample and spatious is the heauen of heauens, which doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close and compasse them; as they doe the aire and earth? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we may be assured that this place is most holy and pure, seeing it is the seat, not only of the holy Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but also of the Lord, who is holinesse it selfe. For if that place of his temporall and momentanie presence, when as he appeared vnto <hi>Moses,</hi> was holy; how much more holy<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 5.</note> are the heauens, which is the place of his continuall resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?

                  <hi>and lies.</hi> Finally, we may be assured though wee cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it according to it worth and excellencie, that it is a
<pb n="885" facs="tcp:10731:480"/> place most glorious and maiesticall. For if the Tabernacle when God gaue some such visible signes of his presence, as the people in their frailty and mortality were capable of, was filled with glory; how ful of glory and maiesty are the<note place="margin">Exod. 40. 34.</note> highest heauens, where God keepeth his chiefe residence, and manifesteth his glory and greatnesse, in a farre greater measure to his Saints and Angels, which are incorruptible and immortal? And this royal excellency being in it selfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable and vnconceiueable; the Apostle describeth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">Apoc. 21. 10. 11.</note> to our weake capacitie, by such visible and earthly things as are most precious and glorious. And first he saith, that this new Ierusalem and city of God, is ful of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and her shining like vnto a stone most precious, and as a Iasper stone, cleere as crystal: that it hath a wall great and high, and twelue gates, and at the gates twelue Angels; that it is both in length and in bredth twelue thousand furlongs; that the building of the wall of it was of Iasper, and the city of pure gold, like vnto glasse, cleere and transparent, pure and glorious: that the foundations of the wall of the city are garnished with all maner of precious stones: the first foundation of Iasper, the second of Saphire, the third of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonie, the fourth of an Emerald, the fifth of a Sardonyx, the sixth of a Sardius, the seuenth of a Chrysolite, the eight, of a Beryl, the ninth of a Topaz, the tenth of a Chrysopra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, the eleuenth of a Iacynth, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> twelfth of an Amethyst. That the twelue gates were twelue pearles, and euery gate of one pearle, and the street of the city pure gold, and like shining glasse. All which if it be to bee vnderstood (as some would haue it) of the glory of the Church here on earth, when as Iewes and Gentiles shal be ioined together before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ to iudgement; it is no lesse forcible to proue that the heauen of heauens is a place most glorious; for if there be such glory, beautie, and maiesty in the Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant, how innumerable degrees shal it be increased and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in the Church triumphant? if there be such excellency to be seene on earth, what shal wee thinke of the heauen of heauens? And surely, if these outcases of this emperial hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the starrie firmament, daily subiect to our view, bee so
<pb n="886" facs="tcp:10731:481"/> glorious? how much more maiestical is that place reserued for Gods saints? If the roofe of our prison and earthly habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be so curiously vaulted, and so richly garnished and bespangled with bright shining lights, and beautiful starres; what workmanship, what maiesty, and incomparable excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency may we expect in the palace of the great king, and the heauenly habitation of the Saints and Angels? If the very porch and first entrie bee so stately and glorious; how full of maiesty, beautie and glory, are the chiefe roomes, and the presence-chamber of this great and glorious monarch of heauen and earth.</p>
               <p>Vnto this glory and happinesse of the place, we may adde<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. Of the great felicity which we shall haue in the society of the saints and Angels.</hi> Mat. 8. 11.</note> that felicity, ioy and contentment which wee shal take in our companie; for first, wee shall haue the societie and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of the Saints and blessed Angels, according to that of our Sauiour Christ, <hi>many shall come from the East and West, and shall sit downe with Abraham, and Isaac, and Iacob, in the kingdome of heauen.</hi> And because there shal bee perfect loue and charity among vs, euery one louing another as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and reioycing as much in their happinesse and felicity as in their owne; hereof it wil come to passe that according to the innumerable number of the Saints and Angels, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely shall our ioyes be doubled and redoubled; and that which one hath not of this glory and happinesse in himselfe, because he is not capable of it, hee shall inioy it through his perfect loue in the rest of this holy and heauenly society; they being mutually one to another storehouses and treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of these euerlasting ioyes, to keepe for their vse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that which themselues cannot containe and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. So that this ioy of loue and perfect charity, shall infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely exceed al other heauēly ioies which belong peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto any one; seeing therby euery one perfectly enioyeth all the happinesse and blessednes of the whole society of the Saints and Angels, whose glory as it is most excellent, so their number numberlesse. Now if these heauenly ioyes bee so vnspeakeable and so incomprehensible in euery one, that he can scarce containe them, how shall we be ranished with ioy and delight, when wee shall communicate in the glory
<pb n="887" facs="tcp:10731:481"/> and happinesse of so great a multitude? And if there be such ioy and sweet content on earth, whilest two or three liuing in all prosperity, dearely loue one another, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing loue imperfectly, and spend the least part of their time in their mutuall fellowship with their beloued friends; what infinite ioy and reioycing shall there be, when all the saints shal be ioyned in their hearts with the bond of perfect charity, and in their persons in a neere fellowship and socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, neuer againe to be separated and diuided? Neither shal heere (as in the earth) propriety vnto these spiritual ioyes, and heauenly treasures be any cause of difference, by reason that the ones hauing them, is the cause why others want them; seeing all these vnualuable riches, and vnspeakeable happinesse shal lie out in common, for the vse and comfort of al the inhabitants. And as al shall ioyntly enioy this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory in an holy communion, so euery one shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy it wholly to himselfe; euen as the sun serueth for the vse and benefit of the whole world; &amp; yet euery one indued with sight inioyeth it wholly, as though no other were partner with him. And therfore because the ones hauing of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly ioy and blessednesse, is so farre from hindring of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that contrariwise through that communion and perfect loue which is amongst them, euery one enioyeth anothers happinesse, and so by this fellowship hath his ioyes infinitely multiplied; from hence will spring vnspeakeable ioy in one anothers loue, and vnconceiueable loue by reason of this ioy.</p>
               <p>But here it may bee demanded, whether in this heauenly<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. Whether we shall in heauen know one another.</hi>
                  </note> societie, we shall know euery one their earthly friends, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and acquaintance. To which I answere, that it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if we would learne to know, and to bee assured, that wee our selues shall be happie members of this heauenly societie; for what will it profit a man to know, that the Saints shall haue this knowledge one of another, if he be ignorant of the meanes whereby he may come to be in this number? Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I answer, that if this particular knowledge, which here we so much desire, would after that manner which we desire it, any whit aduance our ioy and heauenly happinesse; then
<pb n="888" facs="tcp:10731:482"/> most certainely we shall attaine vnto it, and shall euery man know his neere &amp; deare friends, as wife, husband, father, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, sisters, brethren, children, and familiar acquaintance, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing shal be wanting to that felicitie and blessednes, which may make it perfect and compleate; and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise if it will not, we haue no reason greatly to desire it. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, I answere more plainely and directly, that in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly ioyes, we shall all know, and knowing loue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but yet not after a carnall and worldly manner. The former point is more then probable; for being plentifully indued with Gods spirit, and hauing thereby our minds illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with all knowledge and spirituall wisdome, we shall be inabled to know, not onely those who haue been formerly of our acquaintance, but euen strangers, whom we neuer saw. For if <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall, had his mind so inlightned with<note place="margin">Genes. 2. 23.</note> wisdom and knowledge, that he knew <hi>Eue,</hi> and from whence she came, at the first sight; and if the Apostles accompanying<note place="margin">Matth. 17. 4.</note> Christ in his transfiguration, and hauing but a small begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and a little tast of their glorification, were able thereby to know <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> whom they had neuer seene: And (as some adde) if <hi>Diues</hi> (as it is in the parable) knew <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his bosome in so great a distance; then how much more shall they, who are perfectly glorified, and indued with all knowledge, through the illumination of Gods holy spirit, know all their friends and kindred, with whom formerly they haue been acquainted? But yet this knowledge, both in respect of the cause and manner thereof is not worldly and carnall, neither shall we know them by their outward shape and fauour; for this is impossible, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the great difference betweene a bodie mortall, and immortall, earthly and glorified, which, as I said, shall bee freed from all blemishes and imperfections, either of age or stature; nor by the helpe of our naturall memorie, which in such length of time, and greatalterations, which in the mean time shall happen, must of necessitie faile vs; but by that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine illumination of Gods spirit, which maketh acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and strangers all alike knowne vnto vs. In both which respects, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that <hi>from henceforth we know</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 15.</note>
                  <pb n="889" facs="tcp:10731:482"/>
                  <hi>no man after the flesh; yea, though we had knowne Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.</hi> Whereby is meant, that the knowledge which we haue one of another, is not in outward and worldly respects, but diuine and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as we know them in Christ, by the inlightning of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And the like also may be said of our loue towards them, which shall no more be, in regard of our earthly kindred, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and friendship, all which shall be abolished, but in respect that they are the members of Iesus Christ, copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the same ioyes, and fellow members vnited one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother by the same spirit. Neither shall we more reioyce in the societie of our earthly kindred and acquaintance, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter loue them in these earthly respects; for this would not augment and increase, but diminish and detract both from our loue and ioy; seeing this shall be the perfection of them both, to be towards all in the highest degree, louing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing in the happinesse of euery one of Gods Saints, much more then the tenderest mother can loue her child, or wife her husband, and as much as they loue themselues, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in their owne happinesse. And if there bee then any difference in our loue, it shall bee in diuine and spirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, euen as our loue shall be diuine and spirituall, namely, as we shall more loue them, who haue greatest excellency of gifts, and measure of glory, hauing a more perfect apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of God, and that heauenly blessednesse, and the greatest proportion of that holy spirit, which shall be the bond of our vnion, and cause of our loue.</p>
               <p>But as we shall haue knowledge of all the blessed Saints,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. That it shall be a great part of our heauenly happinesse to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the companie of our Sauiour Christ.</hi>

O what rauishing ioy shall then possesse our soules, when as wee, who haue long been contracted to our Lord and husband, shall see that blessed time come, when we shall haue that roiall marriage between him and vs solemnized in the presence of God and his holy Angels, and shall haue the fruition of him, and all his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

All which hee effected by humbling himselfe to the state of a seruant, when he inioyed with his Father all glorie and maiestie, and by suffering miseries and afflictions, hunger, wearinesse, griefe, and worldly contempt skornings, reuilings, buffettings, scourgings; and finally, that sharpe and shamefull death of the crosse, and his Fathers heauie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, much more bitter and intollerable then all the rest of his bodily sufferings.

                  </note> are prepared for the Saints, both in respect of the things within them, and without them; all which, though they are so great, that the heart of man cannot possibly conceiue them; yet are they all but little or nothing, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of that incomprehensible ioy and happinesse, which we shal haue in the fruition of God himselfe, infinite in al goodnesse and perfection; whereby wee shal for euer inioy his presence, behold his face and glorie, and bee vnited vnto him in a blessed &amp; holy communion, that so he may become<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 28.</note> al in al. Which ioy being like the author and obiect thereof, infinit and incomprehensible, it is not to be expected, that I should in the least measure, as it is in it owne nature, expresse it; seeing in regard of it infinit perfection, the heart of man cannot conceiue the least part thereof, much lesse his tongue or pen vtter it; onely I wil content my selfe to haue shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it out in some darke maner, and to discouer it by the light of the word, as it were a farre off, expecting the ful reuelation thereof in the great day of Gods appearing. First therefore we are to know, that as God is the chiefe author and cause of all our happines, electing vs to eternall life before the world was, creating vs vnto glorie, and graciouslie affording vnto vs al the meanes of our saluation; so also he is the chiefe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, and (as it were) materiall cause, and substance, of all our ioy and happinesse. And (as one saith) it is he, both which<note place="margin">August.</note> crowneth vs with a glorious crowne, and is also himselfe this crowne of glorie; it is hee that promiseth, and who is also that which is promised, he is the rewarder, and hee also is our reward. And finally, he giueth vnto vs heauenly happinesse and blessednesse, and is also this blessednesse and felicitie it selfe. And thus the Lord promiseth vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> not onely
<pb n="893" facs="tcp:10731:484"/> that he would reward him greatly, but also that hee himselfe<note place="margin">Genes. 15. 1.</note>
                  <hi>would be his exceeding great reward.</hi> And holy <hi>Dauid</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">Psalm. 16. 5. 11.</note> places calleth the Lord his life, his light, his glorie, his strength, his portion, and the lot of his inheritance: and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally affirmeth, that when he should appeare, hee should bee<note place="margin">Psalm. 17. 15.</note> throughly satisfied with his image, because in his presence is fulnesse of ioy, and pleasures at his right hand for euermore. To which purpose one saith, that it shall be our reward to see<note place="margin">Bernard. medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. deuot. cap. 4.</note> God, to liue with God, to liue of God, to be with God, and to be in God, who shall be all in all; to haue God, who is the <hi>summum bonum,</hi> and chief good; for where the chief good is, there is the chiefe happines, the chiefe pleasure, true libertie, perfect charitie, eternall securitie, and secure eternity; there is true gladnes and reioycing, perfect knowledge, al fulnes, and al blessednes; there is peace, piety, goodnes, light, vertue, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, the ioy of continual mirth, sweetnesse, life eternal; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, praise, rest, loue, and sweet concord. And this (namely, that God is our <hi>summum bonum,</hi> and chief happines) the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens themselues from time to time haue confessed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, as it were casie to shew, had not that ornament<note place="margin">Morn. de verit. relig.

               <p>Now as the Lord is our reward and the perfection of our<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2. That all ioy and happinesse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth our fruition of God, as being the perfection and accomplishment of them all▪</hi>
                  </note> ioy and happines; so we are further to know, that aboue all other rewards he is most excellent; and of all other ioyes, by infinit degrees most delightfull; for whereas other ioyes in heauen exceedingly please, it is he alone that can fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent vs: whereas others are inestimable and of great worth; it is he only who is al-sufficient, and being infinit in al good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and perfection, doth giue vnto vs ful contentment, and compleate happines.

                  <hi>thou vpright:</hi> and hereof it is, that hauing promised in the Reuelation to him <hi>that ouercommeth, that he shall inherit all</hi>

                  <hi>things,</hi> he sheweth how he shall be made thus compleate, saying, <hi>I will be his God, and he shall be my sonne.</hi> And indeed how can he want light, that hath this Sunne of righteousnes still shining vpon him? how can he lacke warmth, who is
<pb n="894" facs="tcp:10731:485"/> continually heated with the flames of this diuine loue? how can he thirst, who hath this euer-springing fountaine which yeeldeth streames of the water of life? And in a word, how can he want any good who enioyeth the chiefe goodnes, in whom all vertue, knowledge, and whatsoeuer goodnes can be named, or desired, are most absolute, and in all fulnes and perfection? For (as one saith) his diuine beautie the Angels<note place="margin">August. de Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plici habitac. cap. 4.</note> wonder at, by his power the dead are raised, of his wisdome there is no number, or measure, whose kingdome knoweth no end, whose glory cannot change, whose light so obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Sunne, that in comparison thereof it is but darknes; who in sweetnes so far exceedeth honie, that being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it is as bitter as wormewood; whose face if the damned soules could behold, they would feele no punishment, no griefe or heauines; whose presence would change hell it selfe into a paradise of pleasure and delight. Wherby it appeareth,<note place="margin">August. de Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu &amp; Anima. cap. 65.</note> not only that God is the chiefe and supreame cause and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of al our felicity and blessednes in the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; but also that he is al-sufficient to make vs perfectly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, as being our <hi>summum bonum,</hi> infinit in all goodnes and perfection. Now further we are to know, that the fruition of this God al-sufficient, and our chiefe and supreame good, is that which we call blessednes, and our heauenly happines. Of which fruition of God, there are made three degrees, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers manners: First when we enioy God in his creatures; in them seeing and vnderstanding his wisedome, power, and goodnes, in his creating, preseruing, gouerning and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of all the creatures in heauen and earth most wisely, mightily, and gratiously. To which purpose the Psalmist saith, that <hi>the heauens declare the glorie of God, and the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalme 19. 1.</note>
                  <hi>sheweth the worke of his hands:</hi> and the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> more plainly affirmeth, <hi>that the inuisible things of God, that is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20▪</note>
                  <hi>his eternall power and God-head, are seene in the creation of the world, being considered in his workes.</hi> Secondly, we are said to enioy him in our selues, and that diuersly in respect of the diuers faculties of our soules, as in our vnderstandings, when they are enlightned with the beames of his wisdome, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine knowledge, whereby we are enabled to know him, and
<pb n="895" facs="tcp:10731:485"/> our selues, together with his will and workes; in our wils and desires, when he replenisheth them with perfect iustice and righteousnesse, whereby they are made conformable to his will (in which sense they are pronounced <hi>blessed, who hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 6.</note>
                  <hi>after righteousnesse, because they shall be satisfied</hi>) and ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to refuse that which God disliketh, and to chuse that which he loueth. Finally, we enioy him in our heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, when as louing him aboue all, and wholly depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon his power and goodnesse, we attaine vnto peace and tranquillitie of mind, and are replenished with all ioy and delight: in which respect we shall be most happie, when as our knowledge cannot puffe vs vp, by reason of our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes, nor our righteousnes be distastefull and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some by reason of our ioy. And lastly, we are said to enioy<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 12.</note> God in himselfe, which of al the rest is most pleasing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull; when we shall know him in his persons, nature, and attributes, not as in this life darkely, and through a glasse, but as the Apostle speaketh, <hi>face to face:</hi> for this (as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour<note place="margin">Iohn▪ 17. 3.</note> saith) <hi>is eternall life to know God, and whom he hath sent Iesus Christ.</hi> Neither shal this fruition consist in a bare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God the Father, his Sonne; and holy Spirit, but in that communion which we shall haue with them, whereby they wil become vnto vs al in al, as we shal see hereafter. And that not in a partie, or imperfect communion, whereby euery of the Saints, should haue their share in this blessed fruition; for God is a most perfect and indiuisible essence, so that they who inioy him, inioy him wholly, without any sharing and diuision. For as on the earth, euery one totally inioyeth the light of the Sun; and as a speech made among a multitude, is not diuided by words and syllables, but is wholly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely receiued of all the hearers: so much more may our God whose essence is most simple, pure, indiuisible, and omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, not filling one place more then another with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, but all alike, whether they bee neere at hand, or more remote; communicate himselfe to bee inioyed totally and wholly, of all, and euery of the blessed Saints.</p>

Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the former; how can it be, but there must needs be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ioy, where God himselfe our chiefe goodnes shal be inioyed? for if the beautie of vertue, being beheld and wel discerned, would (as one saith) stir vp in vs, a wonderful loue<note place="margin">Plato.</note> and admiration of it; how much more wil the sight and frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God doe this, who is the fountaine of all vertue and goodnes, infinit in all glorie and perfection? If the Queene of Saba thought <hi>Salomons</hi> seruants happie, because they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies<note place="margin">1.

If <hi>Moses</hi> attained vnto an extraordinarie measure<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 22. 23.</note> of ioy and happines, when he was admitted to see Gods hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der parts, and some small beames of his infinit glory and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie; how happie and blessed shall we be, when we shall be admitted into his glorious presence, and continually see him face to face? If we so much desire to see, and see with ioy and admiration, men who are excellent in any kind, as those who are exceeding wise, valorous, strong, beautifull, learned, or indued with some extraordinarie parts, although they be but maimed and imperfect; then how shall we be rauished with ioy and holy wonder, when we shal both see and enioy God himselfe, in whom al excellencies do concurre, and that infinitly and in all fulnes and perfection? If we could find a man in whom the graces and good parts, not only of al other
<pb n="897" facs="tcp:10731:486"/> men, but also of al the rest of the creatures, fully concurred, as the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the piety of <hi>Dauid,</hi> y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> loue of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> the wisdome of <hi>Salomon,</hi> the beautie of <hi>Absalon,</hi> the strength of <hi>Sampson,</hi> the sweetnes of odoriferous flowers, the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Sun, &amp;c. who would not admire his excellēcy, and think himself happy, if he might inioy his loue &amp; cōpany? but al the goodnes, beauty, excellencie, and perfection of all the creatures ioyned together, is nothing in comparison of that, which we shal see and enioy in our al-sufficient Creator, they being al but little drops of this euer-springing fountain, smal sparks of this great flame, &amp; lesse thē a graine of sand, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the whole earth &amp; heauēs: seeing he hath in him al beautie, glory, &amp; goodnes, which they haue but in smal por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; he hath y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> in al perfectiō, which they haue imperfectly, and in some little degree; &amp; infinitly aboue al measure, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they haue it but in their measure and proportion. Whereof it is that what excellencies and good parts are ascribed to the creatures (as we say in the concrete) as being properties and qualities of their nature &amp; substāce, they are al attributed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in the abstract, as being his very nature it selfe, and of his essence &amp; being; so the creatures are called good, but the Creator goodnes it selfe; man is said to be wise, holy, iust, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, when as he hath these graces &amp; vertues imparted vnto him; but God is wisdome, holines, iustice, loue, not receiuing them from any other, but hauing them eternally in his owne nature and being. In which respect it is said, that <hi>there is none</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 19. 17.</note>

                  <hi>holy as the Lord, yea none besides him:</hi> because none are so in their owne nature, and from themselues; but what they haue, they haue receiued it from God. From whence we may conclude, that if there be any beautie, excellencie, goodnesse and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the creatures, it is infinitly more in the Creator, from whom they first had it: for if he could without impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his owne excellencie and substance, impart vnto his creatures, such goodnesse, beautie, and perfection, by his sole word, making them of nothing such as they are, and enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with so many good parts and properties, without impouerishing himselfe, or abating any whit of his owne

Do we loue vertue and goodnes in men? they are infinit in the God of vertue and goodnes. Do we delight in wisdome? he is the God of al wisdome and knowledge, from which great light, men haue receiued these little sparkes. Do we desire honors, riches, and pleasures? why he is the God of all glorie, who satisfieth and filleth all with his hidden treasures; and in <hi>his presence is fulnesse of ioy, and at his right hand pleasures for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore.</hi>

                  <pb n="899" facs="tcp:10731:487"/> consisteth in the fruition of our <hi>summum bonum,</hi> and supreme good, which when wee enioy, wee can want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and wanting him, can neuer be satisfied with al other good. For the heart and mind of man is of such large capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, that nothing can fill it but hee who being infinite did first make it. And because God alone is our <hi>summum bonum,</hi> and the supreme end of all our indeauours and desires; therefore if we should inioy al the world, and could engrosse all the pleasures of heauen and earth, wee should not rest sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and contented, because wee haue not attained vnto our end, and that chiefe and supreme good at which wee naturally aime in our desires. Againe, seeing none are bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but those who are perfectly satisfied and contented, and none thus satisfied, but they who enioy God, their <hi>summum bonum,</hi> who, as he freeth them from all euill, so also he reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth them with all good; therefore without this fruition of God, though we should haue neuer so much good, yet we should not attaine vnto full happinesse and felicity.

And therefore he concludeth in another place; that whatsoeuer is present when God is absent, is not sweet and comfortable; and that hee did not desire any, or all those things which God hath giuen, vnlesse he who gaue them, giue himselfe also.

                  </note> the supreme cause and maine obiect of our heauenly happinesse, and that as in the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him consisteth our chiefe blessednesse; so without him we can neuer attaine to true and compleate felicity. In the next place let vs somewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate of the speciall parts of this fruition; which consist ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the vision, sight, and knowledge of God, or in that communion which we shall haue with him. Concerning the former, wee are said in heauen to enioy the vision of God, and to see him, when wee haue not onely in our vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding such a perfect and cleere knowledge of him, his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, attributes, person, will, and workes, as the creature is capable of, but when as thus knowing him, our hearts and affections doe adhere vnto him, in most seruent loue, reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in, and praising him, and conforming our selues in all things according to his will. Neither are wee to conceiue, that this vision is a bare and naked sight and knowledge, but such as is apprehensiue and operatiue, both in our affections and actions. For so these words of sense and knowledge do vsually in the Scriptures signifie, not a bare sight alone, and naked knowledge, whereby the obiect is apprehended in the sense and mind, but also the operations and functions of the will, heart, and affections, together with the effects and actions which doe follow and accompanie this sight and knowledge. So <hi>Dauid</hi> professeth that hee <hi>beleeueth to see the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 27. 13. &amp; 34. 12.</note>
                  <hi>goodnesse of the Lord in the land of the liuing:</hi> that is, to haue the benefit and fruition of it. And Christ saith, that he <hi>who beleeueth not, shall not see life;</hi> and contrariwise, that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 36.</note> shall not see death; whereby is ment, that they should not taste the ioy of the one, nor these the punishment of the other: and elsewhere, that <hi>his sheepe heare his voice,</hi> that is,
<pb n="901" facs="tcp:10731:488"/> beleeue and obey it, in their heart, affections, and conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And thus also we are said to see God, and to know him, not onely when in our vnderstandings wee conceiue some bare notions of his nature and attributes, but also when we apprehend and receiue him into our hearts, soules, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctines, and inioying him, doe reioyce in his fruition. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we vnderstand, not onely what this heauenly vision is, but also what is the chiefe obiect thereof, namely, the Lord himselfe, his nature, persons, glory and maiesty. And this is signified by the seeing of Gods face, of which the Scriptures make mention. Thus the Psalmist saith; <hi>I will behold thy face</hi>

                  <hi>me, hath seene my Father.</hi> But in the life to come wee shall <hi>see God face to face:</hi> that is, with a cleere and manifest know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and not in darke glasses, shadowes, and resemblances: <hi>but as he is.</hi> Not that we shall behold him in his full quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 2.</note>
                  <pb n="902" facs="tcp:10731:489"/> which is infinite, and therefore incomprehensible, but so much as the creature is capable of; and in his nature and attributes, knowing him in his wisedome, power, goodnesse, iustice and the rest (all shadowes and vailes being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way) much more perfectly &amp; clerely then <hi>Adam</hi> did before his fal. For as we know men by their faces, and are able ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to distinguish them from all others; so by that sight of God, whereby we shall with the cleere eyes of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings know his substance, nature, and attributes, wee shall be able not onely to know him in himselfe, but also to distinguish him from all the creatures. Whereby we are not to conceiue that our knowledge of God in this life, and in the life to come shall be diuers in themselues, and differing in their substance and essence, but onely in degree and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; for so the Apostle saith, that <hi>now we know in part,</hi> that is, imperfectly and obscurely, but <hi>then face to face.</hi> Whereby<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 11.</note> he signifieth, that this knowledge of God in this life, is a part and beginning of the other, and not of a diuers kind and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature. And that wee know and vnderstand as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: whereby is meant, that as children haue but a weake and imperfect knowledge, whereby they do but after a chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish maner conceiue of high matters, as of kings, empires, forraine countries, State affaires, when they heare their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents talking of them, sometimes imitating them in their words and discourses, and not cleerely vnderstanding what they say; but when they come to riper age, they haue, in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance indeed and nature, the same vnderstanding and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but in farre greater growth, perfection and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; euen as they haue being men; the same bodies which they had in their infancie, but much more strong and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. And as we see the same sunne, with the same eyes, and after the same mane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For here we fee God and conceiue of the ioyes of his
<pb n="903" facs="tcp:10731:489"/> kingdome, after a simple, weake, and childish maner, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them as wee haue heard and read in the word of our heauenly Father, and not perfectly vnderstanding what wee say, because wanting experience and perfect vnderstanding of that which wee discourse of, wee are notable to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it. But in the life to come we shall see God face to face, and know him as wee are knowne, that is, cleerely, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, substantially, and essentially, without any darke riddles or shadowes of obscurity; without which vision and knowledge there could be ho perfection of happinesse. For then alone are we truely blessed, when as wee haue our wils and all our desires throughly satisfied; but it is impossible that we should bee thus satisfied and contented, vnlesse wee be filled with this diuine nature, in our vnderstandings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending, and with our wils, desires, and affections, louing and imbracing this most perfect substance, and diuine es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; seeing (as I haue said) their capacity is so large, that nothing but an infinite goodnesse can fill and satisfie them. Neither is it possible that our minds should bee contented and at quiet, when as we see many excellent effects, and doe not know the more excellent causes, and when as we behold and know the beautifull creatures, and are ignorant, or not throughly acquainted with the Creator himselfe, of infinite more beautie and perfection.</p>
               <p>Whereby we are not grosly to conceiue, that we shall see<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 2.

And as we cannot in this life see the substance and essence of our soules with our bodily eyes; but yet can with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them in the functions, operations, and actions which they exercise in the body; so though we cannot visiblie and sensiblie see the inuisible and incomprehensible God in his owne spirituall nature and being; yet may wee behold him in his creatures, exercising in them his wisedome, power, and goodnesse, especially in that liuely character, and perfect pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, his son Iesus Christ. But our chiefe vision and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God shall be spirituall in our soule, mind, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, wherewith wee shall cleerely behold Gods es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and nature, in all his attributes and perfections, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so his persons, conceiuing the great mysterie of the Trinitie, the Father, Son, and holy Spirit, in the Vnity of their most simple and vndiuided nature; and cleerely knowing the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal generatiō of the Son by the Father, &amp; the proceeding of the holy Spirit, and what distinction and difference there is betweene them. Then shal we know how al things in God are one and the same (except only the relation of the persons one to another) and that there is no diuersitie of faculties, but one pure and perfect essence, nor his wisedome, goodnesse, iustice, mercy, and the rest of the attributes different the one from the other, but all one and the same in God, yea of God, as being all of his essence and being. Then shall we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how God is wholly euery where, &amp; yet without place, great without quantitie, &amp; good without quality. Then shall we know those great mysteries of Christs two natures conioyned in the same person in the hypostaticall vnion, and of the vnion of our bodies with our head Christ, by the same
<pb n="905" facs="tcp:10731:490"/> spirit dwelling in vs; whereby wee become flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones, though wee be farre remote the one from the other; then shall we be acquainted with the causes of Gods eternall counsell in our election, creation, redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; in the gathering and gouerning of his Church, with all other his works of wonder. Then shal we know the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual substances of Angels, the nature, essence, &amp; beginning of our owne soules; together with the hidden formes of other creatures. In a word, euery mysterie or secret whatsoeuer which is profitable, and the knowledge therof by vs desired, shall there be vnderstood of vs; seeing blessednes consisteth in full contentment, and we cannot rest quiet &amp; content, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse our desires be perfectly satisfied. Al which excellent and bottomlesse mysteries shall not grow stale and common vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Saints as soone as they haue conceiued them, but for euer remaine new and wonderfull; neither shall they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in the beholders lesse admiration and wonder after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">August. de tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plici habitacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo. cap. 4. 6.</note> thousand yeeres beholding them, then at their first illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and acquaintance with them. So that being illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with that diuine light of Gods holy spirit, wee shall not only see God, but by him his workes and creatures; and as in this life wee see God in the creatures, so in the life to come, we shall see the creatures in and by God; for then hee alone shall be our sunne which shall giue vs all our light, as<note place="margin">Apoc. 21. 23.</note> the holy Ghost speaketh. And as in this world wherin things are sensible, we haue our power of seeing the creatures from the benefit of the sunne inlightning the ayre, and the obiect, that we may behold and discerne it; so God the intelligible sunne of the world, with the beames and light of his holie spirit, doth so illighten the minds of the blessed, that thereby they are inabled to see his owne face and essence, will, and counsels, with open and cleere view, and also his creatures and workes of wonder which he hath made for our delight and admiration, and for his owne praise and glorie. By all which it appeareth that one of the greatest parts of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly happinesse, consisteth in our vision and ioyfull know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, whereby wee shall not onely know himselfe, but his creatures and workes of excellencie, in and by the
<pb n="906" facs="tcp:10731:491"/> light of his spirit. So our Sauiour saith, that the pure in heart are <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 5. 8.</note> blessed, because they shall see God: and that <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 17. 3.</note> eternall life cōsisteth in the knowledge of God, and his sonne Christ. So the holy Apostles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> doe make it a chiefe part of our happinesse, that we shall <note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 12.</note> see God face to face, know him as we are knowne, and <note n="d" place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 2.</note> see him as he is. And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, that beholding Gods face in righteousnes, he should be <note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 17. 15.</note> satisfied with his image. And hence it is that our Sauiour earnestly desiring the happinesse of his seruants, doth intreate of his Father, that those whom he had <note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 17. 24.</note> giuen him might be with him, and behold his glorie. And this stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with good reason that this vision and knowledge of God should be a chiefe and principall part of our happinesse; first, because our vnderstanding being the chiefest facultie of the chiefest part of man, it must needs be a chiefe part of our ioy and glorie to haue it satisfied and contented. But how can it be satisfied, if seeing excellent effects, it doe not see the cause; and if knowing the rare workes of God, it doe not also know the workman? Againe, if there should be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen no true knowledge of God, there could be no loue of him, and consequently no pleasure and delight: for howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we may loue an euill thing, yet wee cannot loue a thing vnknowne; and if wee doe not loue it, we take no comfort or ioy in the being of it. So that take away knowledge, and take away loue and delight; and contrariwise, presuppose excellencie and perfection of the obiect, and the greater our knowledge is, the greater will be our loue, the greater also our pleasure and contentment in the fruition of it.</p>
               <p>The other part of our fruition of God, is our communion<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. Of that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which we shall haue with God in the kingdome of heauen.</hi>
                  </note> with him; neither shall wee onely see and behold him in all his goodnes, glorie, and maiestie, but we shall also in a most blessed manner be vnited vnto him, and communicate with him in all his happinesse, which is the supreme end of our creation and redemption, and the very perfection of our glorification. For therefore did the Lord create vs according to his own image, &amp; conformable to himself in wisedom, righteousnes and holines, that he might dwell with vs, &amp; in vs, as in his holy temple and habitation, and that wee might
<pb n="907" facs="tcp:10731:491"/> haue communion with him in all his excellencies and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And when this communion was dissolued and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off by the fall of our first parents, and our sinnes had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated betweene our God and vs, because our bodies and<note place="margin">Esay 59. 2.</note> soules being corrupted and defiled with sin and wickednes, were more fit to be the habitations and dwelling places of the wicked and vncleane spirits, then the temples of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost; then the Lord louing vs as his creatures ordained to glorie, with an eternall loue, and taking compassion of our miserable condition, sent his sonne into the world to bee our mediatour, and to repaire this communion betweene him and vs, by taking our nature vpon him, and vniting it to the diuine nature, that so it being vnited to his Deitie, and we to his Humanitie, by this mediation and bond we might be reunited vnto him, and that much more perfectly then in our first creation. So that the bond of our vnion with God is our Sauiour Christ, who being God and man, by his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature assumed, vniteth vs to God, and by his diuine nature assuming, vniteth God vnto vs, and by vertue of this vnion maketh vs partakers of God, and to haue communion with him in all his goodnesse and diuine excellencies, and to become againe the habitations of God, and the temples of his holy spirit. Now the meanes whereby we are vnited vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, he becomming our head, and we the members of his bodie, are not onely his assuming of our nature, but also our receiuing of his spirit, whereby being vnited vnto Christ, and becomming one with him, as the head &amp; mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body are one, because they are informed with the same soule, wee are quickned thereby and doe liue the <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 2. 20. Col. 3. 3. 4.</note>
                  <hi>life of Christ,</hi> as the Apostle speaketh. So it is said, that <hi>wee</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Ephe. 2. 22.</note>
                  <hi>are built together to be the habitation of God by the spirit,</hi> that <note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 13.</note>
                  <hi>by one spirit we are baptized into one body,</hi> that <note n="d" place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 17.</note>
                  <hi>he who is ioyned with the Lord, is one spirit with him;</hi> and contrariwise, that <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 8. 9.</note>
                  <hi>he who hath not the spirit of Christ, the same is none of his.</hi> The which communion betweene God and vs through Iesus Christ, is begun in this life, truly, though in respect of the degree, it be weake and imperfect: for as we haue receiued but the first fruites of the spirit, so wee haue but a small and
<pb n="908" facs="tcp:10731:492"/> weake entrance into this communion, and that by certaine inferiour meanes and instruments. For first by baptisme wee are outwardly and sacramentally ingrafted into the body of Christ, and after by the preaching of the Gospell, made effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall by the inward operation of Gods holy spirit, a liuely faith is begun in vs, wherby we applie vnto our selues Christ and all his benefits, and so haue communion and fellowship with him. The which vnion and communion is more and more confirmed by the receiuing of the Lords Supper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by it our faith, which is on our part the bond thereof, is strengthened and increased.</p>
               <p>But howsoeuer this communion with God and his sonne<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. That our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God shall be much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect then it is in this life.</hi>
                  </note> Christ, be the same in nature and substance, with that which we haue with them in this life, yet doe they exceedingly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the quantitie and degree, in the inferiour meanes which God vseth to haue communion with vs, and in the bond on our part, whereby wee are vnited vnto Christ. For then we hauing fulnes of the spirit, shall be fully and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnited vnto our head and Sauiour, and through him vnto God; inioying him in a neere, excellent, and vnspeakeable manner. And whereas in this life God communicateth vnto vs himselfe, his mercie, and goodnesse, by inferiour meanes, and secondarie causes; as his spirituall graces, by the meanes and ministerie of his word and Sacraments; his temporall benefits tending to our preseruation, and the maintenance of our liues, by his creatures, as meate, drinke, clothing, the sun, ayre, earth, and the rest; after this life these inferious causes and meanes shall cease, and God without them <hi>shall be all in all,</hi> supplying vs with all things which we can desire, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly by his owne al-sufficiencie, and perfecting our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse by himselfe alone, without any helpes or inferiour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments. Finally, the bond of our vnion with Christ in this<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note> life, is a true faith, which in the life to come shall cease, and we shall be vnited vnto him, and through him vnto God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly by his spirit, which shall dwell in vs. And on our part, in stead of faith, we shal be vnited vnto the blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, by that perfect vision and knowledge of God, it being the nature of true and effectuall knowledge, to comprehend
<pb n="909" facs="tcp:10731:492"/> and (as it were) to infold as much as may bee the obiect or thing knowne, either receiuing it selfe, or the species and forme thereof into the mind and vnderstanding: and by that perfect loue, which we shall haue of God the Father, his Sonne, and holy spirit, the nature whereof is, to transforme (as much as may be) the party louing into the thing beloued, and to make all things common betweene them. Whereby we may partly, and in some darke manner vnderstand, what that diuine and holy vnion betweene God and vs shall be in the life to come: namely, a communion with God, in all his goodnesse and perfections, through the spirit of God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in vs, vniting vs first vnto Christ, and in him to God the Father; and through our knowledge and loue of God, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inioying him, whereby we shall become the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and temples of the Deitie, in which it will eternally dwell, and God shall be come vnto vs <hi>all in all,</hi> immediately quickning, preseruing, and glorifying vs by himselfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe and ministerie of inferiour meanes. And of this vnion, the scriptures speake plentifully. For so the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saith, that we shall be <hi>made partakers of</hi>

                  <hi>I pray</hi> (saith he) <hi>for all that shall beleeue in me, that they all may be one, as thou O Father art in me, and I in thee, euen that they may bee also one in vs.</hi> And in this respect, they are said to bee the Temples of God, in which he dwelleth. <note n="c" place="margin">2.

                  <hi>Yee are</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>the temple of the liuing God; as God hath said, I will dwell among them, and walke there: I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</hi> So elsewhere he saith, that <note n="d" place="margin">Ephes. 2. 22.</note>
                  <hi>we are built to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to be the habitation of God by the spirit.</hi> And this is the voice of God from heauen, <note n="e" place="margin">Apoc. 21. 4. §. <hi>Sect. 5.

               </p>
               <p>And this is that communion which the glorified Saints shall haue with God and our Sauiour Christ, the fruits and benefits whereof are infinit and inestimable: for communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating with God, who is infinit in al perfections, in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, glorie, and excellencie, we shall abound with all bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
<pb n="910" facs="tcp:10731:493"/> which our hearts can desire, and farre aboue all which we can conceiue; for whether it be glory, riches, pleasures, beautie, loue, wisdome, or whatsoeuer other excellencies we can conceiue, we shall find them infinitely contained in the fountaine and treasurie of all goodnesse. Againe, being vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto God, and communicating with him in the vertue and power of his holy spirit, we shall be quickned thereby, and liue the life of God, in puritie, eternitie, and all perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not in the quantitie, for God is infinit in all good, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

And as the blind man is said to haue dead eies, when they are depriued of light and sight; so the soule is dead, if it doe not inioy God, the life of blessednesse. Furthermore by vertue of this communion it commeth to passe, that God al-sufficient is vnto <hi>vs all in all,</hi> as the Apostle speaketh, that is, doth free vs from all euill, and replenish and furnish vs with all good, which our hearts can desire, and that immediately by himselfe, and not by secondarie helpes, and inferiour meanes, as he doth in this life. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose elsewhere he desireth, that the Ephesians <hi>might know the loue of Christ, which passeth all knowledge; that they might bee sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 3. 19.</note>
                  <hi>with all fulnesse of God.</hi> In this life, God is not thus al in all, as he will be in the life to come, partly because he vseth for the procuring of our good, many meanes and instruments by which he worketh; and partly because he doth not giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs all things in any excellencie and perfection; in which respect it is truly said, that Gods gifts are not <hi>now all in all,</hi> but<note place="margin">Hieron. epist. 37. ad Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. presbyt.</note> some in euery man, as Wisdome in <hi>Salomon,</hi> pietie in <hi>Dauid,</hi> patience in <hi>Iob,</hi> and so in the rest; but in our heauenly happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, when <hi>God shall be all in all,</hi> we shall excel in all goodnes, vertue, glorie and perfection. Neither shall wee then need any thing, because we shall inioy God al-sufficient, who will by himselfe supplie all our wants, and grant vnto vs all our wishes. So the Apostle saith, that in the heauenly Ierusalem,<note place="margin">Apoc. 21. 22. 23.</note>
                  <hi>there shall bee no temple, for the Lord God al-mightie, and the
<pb n="911" facs="tcp:10731:493"/> Lamb shall be the temple of it,</hi> &amp; we shal worship God in God: nor <hi>Sunne or Moone to shine in it, for the glorie of the Lord shall light it, and the Lambe shall be the light of it.</hi> And therefore we shall no more need these worldly lights, then we need the light of a candle, when the Sunne shineth. We shall not need the Word and Sacraments, as meanes wherby we may more firmely be vnited vnto God; for then God will communicate himselfe vnto vs immediately without these secondarie and inferiour helps. Neither shall we need food, apparell, sleepe, and other meanes of preseruing life, seeing God will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately quicken vs, by his holy spirit dwelling in vs. And this shall be the perfection of our heauenly happinesse, that God most wise, omnipotent, and al-sufficient, shal by himselfe free and preserue vs from euil, and fil and furnish vs with al good: and though when wee haue spoken neuer so much of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall blessednesse, wee cannot attaine vnto the excellencie<note place="margin">Eccles. 43. 27.</note> thereof, yet let vs know, that <hi>this is the summe of all, that God is all,</hi> as the sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> speaketh. Finally, by our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, we shall become as like vnto him, as a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit creature may resemble the infinit Creatour; like in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, like in glory, like in eternitie, and in all perfection; for so the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>that we shall all behold as in a mirrour,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 18.</note>
                  <hi>the glory of the Lord with open face, and shall be changed into the same image from glorie to glorie, as by the spirit of the Lord.</hi> And the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>that when he shall appeare, we shall be like vnto him, because we shall see him as he is.</hi> For as a drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Cyprian. de singular. cleric.</note> being put into a vessell of wine, hath it owne nature alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and receiueth both the taste and colour of the wine: And as iron lying long in the fire, retaining it owne substance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth the fires properties of light and heate, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth like vnto it: And as the Sunne beames shining in the aire, do make it bright and cleare, like the Sunne it selfe: And finally, as a glasse hauing the Sun shining on it, retaineth in it a liuely image of the Sunne both in figure and light: so the faithfull being conuersant with God vnto all eternitie, shal be, as it were, swallowed vp of that infinit excellencie; and though they retaine their owne nature and substance, yet shal they bee so indued with diuine qualities, that they shal
<pb n="912" facs="tcp:10731:494"/> be liuely images, and, as it were, little models of Gods infinit goodnesse, glorie and perfection. And to conclude all in a word, by this communion we shall attaine vnto perfect bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse, wee hauing in God whatsoeuer wee desire. For (as one saith) What seekest thou that is not in him? What de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirest<note place="margin">Bernard. de miseria hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana serm.</note> thou besides him? What pleaseth thee without him? Hee hath made all, hee hath all, hee is all. Whatsoeuer good thing thou desirest, whatsoeuer beautifull thing thou likest, whatsoeuer sweet and delightfull thing thou requirest, in him thou shalt find it, and in him thou shalt inioy it. If thou wilt reioyce, he is ioy; if thou wilt striue, hee is the garland; if thou wilt be crowned, he is the crowne; if thou wilt ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, he is the victorie; if thou desire power, he is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; if fortitude, he is a God of strength; if righteousnes, he is iustice it selfe; if prudence, he is the fountaine of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; if charitie, hee is loue; if riches, he is a treasure that can neuer faile; if thou wouldest be beautifull, he is beautie it selfe; if thou seekest honor, he is a God of glory and maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie; if peace, he is peace eternall; if fulnesse of all good, he is an infinit and inexhaustable goodnesse, and whatsoeuer good thou canst desire, this <hi>summum bonum,</hi> and chiefe good shal replenish thee with it.</p>

                  <hi>is loue, and hee that dwelleth in loue, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi> So the Lord is the efficient cause of our loue, whilest hee communicateth himselfe vnto vs, who is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of all loue, and with the infinit flames of his loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, doth inflame our hearts with loue towards him: and the obiect likewise of our affection, being most louely and full of all beautie, excellencie, and affection. And finally, he is the supreme end, and from him alone haue we all the fruit of our loue, whilest imbracing him in our harts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, who containeth all good and perfection, we are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie satisfied, replenished with delight, and made thereby most happie and blessed. For seeing it is the nature of loue to vnite the person louing, with the thing beloued, yea, to transforme him as much as may be, into the same nature, and to adorne him with the same excellencies which it affecteth: and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our loue of God shall be so perfect, that we shal loue him with all the powers of our soules, much more ardently then we doe our selues; hereof it will come to passe, that wee shall much more reioyce in his glory and blessednes, then in our owne; and the fuller our hearts be with his loue, the more ioy shall we haue in beholding his felicitie. As therefore we loue God because he communicateth vnto vs heauenly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, so shall we be most happie, because we loue him. For then are we perfectly blessed, when we haue the full fruition of our <hi>summum bonum,</hi> and chiefe happinesse; and the chiefe meanes, whereby we imbrace and inioy it, is, when our wils desire it, and our hearts and affections are set vpon it. And as wee are thus happie and blessed, because wee shall perfectlie loue the Lord, so much more, because he will loue vs, both because his loue is infinit, and far beyond all degrees of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison surpassing ours, and also because it is actiue, opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
<pb n="915" facs="tcp:10731:495"/> and most powerfull to communicate vnto vs all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and perfection; for louing our being, he causeth vs to be; louing vs by his grace, he communicateth grace vnto vs; louing vs vnto glorie and eternall happines, he doth by this loue glorifie vs, and make vs happle. Wherein the loue of God infinitly exceedeth the loue of men: for they loue one another, because they find them worthie their loue, as being beautifull, good, vertuous, and indued with good parts; but God by his louing vs, maketh vs worthie his loue; and doth not therefore first loue vs, because we are good, beautifull, and full of vertue, and perfection, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For though we were sure they should conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue many hundred thousand of yeeres, yet if wee also knew, that they would then end and leaue vs, wee should bee as much discontented, that the time would come when as we should be depriued of them, as comforted in their present fruition; yea the greater and more excellent our ioyes should be whilest we haue them, the greater would in this respect our sorrow and griefe be, to thinke that we should once bee dispolled of them; whereas now finding them for deepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent infinite, and in respect of the time to come endlesse, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be added to their perfection.

For if men for the obtaining of a corruptible crowne, are content to oppresse themselues with cares, to endure all labours, to runne a thousand desperate courses, and euen to hazard their owne soules; yea if they be willing for the smallest preferments and profits of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to trauell by sea and land, to spend their strength, and consume their bodies, and to indanger themselues daily to many deaths, though (as I haue shewed) they are but of small worth, and lesse certaintie for their continuance; what cares, dangers, and labours should wee thinke too much for the obtaining of a crowne, which is most glorious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, and a kingdome without end? But yet alas, such is either the great infidelitie of men, that they doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue these things, though God who is truth it selfe doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise them; or their negligence, that they neuer so much as thinke and meditate vpon them; or their securitie and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, that they hope to obtaine this kingdome whether they seeke it or no; or finally, such is their prophanenes and carnall follie, that they esteeme these earthly and momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie trifles, vaine honours, vncertaine riches, and brutish plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, more then these vnspeakable ioyes and euerlasting glorie. For that they stand thus affected, it may plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by their practise and our daily experience. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if any man of credit should promise vnto them, I will not say a kingdome, but some small profit, pleasure, or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vpon condition that they will take some paines in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and seeking to obtaine it; how readily and earnestly will they become seekers and suers, that they may inrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with these earthly benefits? but when Christ the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall veritie, who neuer sailed of his word, offereth this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly kingdome of his free grace, as a reward of their paines, if they will labour to obtaine it; how little doe they regard it? how slowly doe they seeke it? thereby shewing mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
<pb n="927" facs="tcp:10731:501"/> that either they doe not beleeue Gods promise; or doe so basely esteeme the thing promised, that they preferre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it these worldly trifles and worthlesse vanities. If an earthly King should promise to his subiect some great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and high preferments; on this condition, that he shew himselfe dutifull and obedient, in performing some of his lawfull commandements; with how great care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence would hee yeeld obedience? and how much more if he should promise, yea and confirme it by his hand, seale, and oath, that hee would adopt him for his sonne, and make him heire apparant of his kingdome? But when God thus promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his heauenly benefits, and offereth vnto vs his kingdom of glorie, and to make vs heires of this eternal inheritance, if wee will bestow any paines in seeking of it; how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ew are the number that regard his promises, or bestow any labour in attaining to this assurance? and yet there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, both in respect of the persons promising, &amp; the things promised. For a King being mortal, and mutable, may either die, and so cannot; or change his minde vpon some displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and so will not performe his promise; or though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these fall out, hee may die to whom the promise is made, before him that made it, and so neuer come to inherit the kingdome: But God is immortall and immutable, and as he cannot die, so he cannot be changed, and therefore will most certainly performe his promise, if wee performe the condition of our dutie and obedience. And againe, there is great difference between the things promises, euen as great, as is betweene heauen and earth, a substance and a shadow, momentany pleasure, and euerlasting ioy, betweene a flitting and fading kingdome, incumbred with many croffes and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and a kingdome absolute in all perfection, infinite, endlesse, replenished with all glorie, ioy and riches, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to no trouble and incumbrance.</p>

<pb n="928" facs="tcp:10731:502"/> which are in earth, so much let our loue, care, &amp; paines exceed in desiring and seeking to obtaine them. And that wee may not spend our paines in the trauelling of a wrong way, and so in the end complaine that we haue laboured in vaine, let vs make choice of that only way Iesus Christ, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be true members ingrafted into his glorious bodie<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 6.</note> by a liuely faith, that so in him we may be the sonnes of God, and the adopted heires of his glorious kingdome. Let vs adioyne our selues to the kingdome of grace, professing our subiection vnto God, and communicating with the rest of the Saints in the exercises of the true religion; as calling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, hearing his word, receiuing his Sacraments, and submitting our selues to be ordred and ruled by the outward discipline and gouernment of the Church. Yea we must not only outwardly professe our selues the subiects and seruants of God, but wee must also liue like his subiects in obedience to his will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

For if these earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things which carnall worldlings doe so much affect, bee vaine and worthles, and Gods spiritual graces, and heauenly ioyes be most excellent and precious; they vnprofitable euen in this life, and these most beneficiall both in this life, and the life to come; if they in themselues are miserable comforters, and bring many other miseries attending on them, and these most sweete and delightfull, without the mixture of any euil; if they be vnceraine to be gotten by those who loue them, and fugitiue to those who most run after them, and these most assuredly obtained by those who desire them, and vse the meanes whereby they may inioy them; if they be as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain in their possession, as in their pursuit, being euery day readie to leaue their owners, or their owners to leaue them, and these most constant, permanent and eternall▪ finally, if they through our corruption abusing them, doe so much hurt vs, being the causes, occasions, and instruments of so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold euils; and these so much benefit vs, adorning vs with all glory, inriching vs with al good, replenishing vs, both in our soules and bodies with all ioyes, pleasures and delights, and making vs in all respects truly happie, and eternally blessed: what doting folly and franticke madnesse is it, either in our iudgements or affections, to preferre the worlds base, worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and momentany trifles, before these inestimable iewels, and heauenly treasures? We account him a child or a foole, who wil preferre a counter before a kingdome, a shadow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a substance, and euery base trifle, before his patrimonie and inheritance: and we both wonder and laugh at the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of the barbarous nations, who will exchange their gold and pearles, for a knife or glasse; but how much more absurd and ridiculous is their follie and madnesse, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre earth before heauē, mammon before God, and the vaine pleasures of sin, which last but for a season, before the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glorie, and those vnspeakeable ioyes which shal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer end? Let vs therefore beware of this worldly frensle;
